<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The principles of American constitutional law
are the foundation of all judicial decisions, and it is
(as Marshall observes) “the province and duty of
the Courts to say what the law is.” Judicial
decisions, however, are technical, are handed down
by experts, and set forth authoritatively as results
of experience which the junior student of the law
is likely to find difficult, if not incomprehensible.
But to attempt merely to simplify the law, or its
interpretation by the Courts, is likely to result in
variation from the original spirit and purpose of the
law: because decisions are essentially a reduction of
questions at issue to a principle, and laws themselves
are (or ought to be) simple, clear, comprehensive,
and complete.</p>

<p>For purposes of study or instruction it is necessary
to bring the principle involved in a law (be it the
Supreme Law of the Land,—that is, the Constitution,
a Treaty, or an Act of Congress; or a State Constitution,
or an Act of a State Legislature) within the
compass of a principle, or a fundamental, by examination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
of an issue, or issues, in which the principle is
involved. There must ever be before the Court
the issue <em>and</em> the law, and the law itself may be an
issue, in the American system of government which
recognizes the authority of the Court to pass on the
constitutionality of the law.</p>

<p>But principles are not numerous. Possibly in
Nature there is but one basic principle and all our
so-called “natural laws” are but aspects of that
principle as the human mind conceives or recognizes
it. The analogy in government permits the assertion
that the principles of constitutional law are
few. Possibly they are severally aspects of one
principle: that of sovereignty. To the student of
the law, especially to junior students, principles are
matters of memory rather than of understanding.
It is a vigorous and essentially mature mind that
can reduce a complex issue to such simple form as to
deduce the principle on which it rests.</p>

<p>Books on American constitutional law should be
simple, comprehensive, authoritative, and specially
adapted to the conditions under which the subject
is pursued. In later years the subject is usually
approached through two books: a treatise on constitutional
law, and a book (collection) of leading
cases illustrative of the principles involved. The
tendency is toward bulky volumes. Meanwhile
other subjects than constitutional law,—other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span>
branches of the law,—must be pursued. Multiplicity
of subjects is characteristic of the curriculum
whether at Law School or at College or University.
Time is brief: studies are many. The necessary
result is concentration upon the essentials of a
subject,—careful isolation of its principles together
with familiarity with authoritative illustrations of
their application. This means a small, compact,
authoritative book on the subject. There are few
principles,—there are innumerable applications of
them. Values are twofold,—perception of the
principle, and understanding of its application.
The question is not “What principle?” but rather,
“What application?” Thus the student of law may
wisely be led to consider, to weigh, to study the
great or the leading application of a principle: that
is, he is properly directed to the important decisions
of the Courts of Law. In America, these decisions
are handed down by the Supreme Courts of States
and the Supreme Court of the United States. From
these decisions the principles of our constitutional
law may be derived. Great writers, like Hamilton,
Madison, Kent, Story, or Cooley, must be listened
to: but it is the Court of Law that speaks with
authority. Our great writers on constitutional law
and our great judges sitting as Courts of Law practically
agree as to what comprise the principles of
our constitutional law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
Whether the principles of the law are reached
by induction or by deduction does not affect the
principles. Judicial decisions illustrate both methods
of approach. Stated broadly,—a treatise on constitutional
law sets forth its principles and cites
decisions as illustrations of their application; a
collection of cases provides many illustrations from
which the principles may be, or are, deduced. By
combining the treatise and the case-book (and the
present volume may be used in connection with any
of the current “Collections” of “Leading Cases”)
the benefits of both methods,—deductive and inductive,—are
realized. Whether the two sorts of books
are used together, or in succession, must depend
upon the time, the place, and the importance assigned
to the subject itself. Highly beneficial results
have followed when a first semester has been given to
the treatise, and a second to the cases, whether in a
“Collection” (of which there are several of highest
value now in use), or in the original “Reports.”</p>

<p>But constitutional law is more than a technical
subject for a Law School: it is a branch or part of
the study of government,—of political philosophy
so-called. It is a branch of “Politics” as Aristotle
uses that word. Hence it is also a “culture” study,
entitled to a respectable place in the curriculum of
College or University. But as such a study, it must
also be pursued as are other branches of philosophy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
Whatever part it has as dialectics it also has part
in the interpretation of the government,—of the
sovereignty behind that government,—under which
we live. The difficulties of constitutional law are
also the difficulties of government and of philosophy
itself.</p>

<p>Shall the college man leave college with a fair
knowledge of the principles of the Supreme Law
under which he lives? That is the question. Whatever
book or books or method best brings that consummation
is the best.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE SUPREME LAW</span></h2>

<p>1. The supreme law of the land is the Constitution,
and acts of Congress and treaties made under its
authority. By this supreme law the judges in every
State are bound, “anything in the constitution or
laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.”
All legislative, executive, and judicial officers both of
the United States and of the several States are bound
by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution,
and in our actual government, every administrative
official, State or national, is bound in like manner.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
Aliens becoming American citizens by naturalization,—by
which they disavow allegiance to any other
sovereignty,—solemnly bind themselves, by oath or
affirmation, to support the Constitution. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
citizen is impliedly under oath to support the
Constitution.</p>

<p>2. Such supremacy of the Constitution is essential
to American sovereignty. The people of the United
States ordained and established this supreme law.
They are sovereign. The oath or affirmation to support
it is the formal and sovereign promise of fidelity
to that sovereign, to any sovereign, or quasi-sovereign,—for
example, to England, France, or a State
in the American Union. The supreme law of a
sovereignty,—its “constitution,” may be written,
like ours, or partly unwritten, as the British constitution.
The essential fact is of the supremacy of
the law because of the sovereignty of the law-giver.</p>

<p>3. The laws of the United States are made by
Congress and the President, or by Congress alone
over his veto.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> The laws of a State are made by its
legislature and governor, or by the legislature alone
over his veto; but Congress, the President, State
legislature and governors are only agents of their
sovereign: they possess <em>derivative</em>, not <em>original</em>,
powers; they <em>represent</em> sovereignty. The American
sovereign is “We the People” of the United States,
and for many purposes, “We the People” of the
respective States. All government in America is
representative government. The sovereign makes
laws through its agents or representatives. No other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
method is possible in a sovereignty conceived and
operating as ours. Whether the law thus formulated
be a constitution,—national or State,—an act of
Congress or of Assembly, it is an expression, on the
principle of agency, of the will of the sovereign. The
Convention that frames a constitution is an agent of
sovereignty; the Congress or State Legislature that
enacts a law is an agent of that sovereignty, and that
sovereignty prescribes through its agents the method
of ratifying and administering that law. Through
other agents, e. g., the judiciary, that sovereignty
interprets constitutions and laws.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> Legislative, executive,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
judicial, and administrative officials constitute
the governmental group, the public servants to
whom, for a term, the sovereign delegates some of
its powers. The members of this group are agents of
the sovereign and are answerable to that sovereign
as is the agent to his principal.</p>

<p>4. Madison, in <cite>The Federalist</cite>, states the whole
case: A republic is</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">a government which derives all its powers directly or
indirectly from the great body of the people, and is
administered by persons holding their offices during
pleasure, for a limited period, or during good behavior.
It is essential to such a government that it be derived
from the great body of the society, not from an inconsiderable
proportion, or a favored class; otherwise a handful
of tyrannical nobles, exercising their oppressions by a
delegation of their powers, might aspire to the rank of
republicans, and claim for their government the honorable
title of republic. It is sufficient for such a government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
that the persons administering it be appointed,
either directly or indirectly, by the people, and that they
held their appointments by either of the tenures just
specified; otherwise every government in the United
States, as well as every other popular government that
has been or can be well organized or well executed, would
be degraded from the republican character.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p></blockquote>

<p>5. The supreme law of the land represents the
will of the people of the United States for purposes of
government. The authority of that law is derived
wholly from the people. They may change or amend
it at any time. They prescribe the procedure for such
change or amendment.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Through this supreme law
the entire public business is carried on. The constitution
of Massachusetts sets forth the essential fact:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">All power residing originally in the people, and being
derived from them, the several magistrates and officers
of government, vested with authority, whether legislative,
executive, or judicial, are their substitutes and agents,
and are at all times accountable to them.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The distinction between original and derivative
powers made by the constitution of Massachusetts
is true of the supreme law of the United States.</p>

<p>6. The quality of supremacy involves and implies
sovereignty. Sovereignty is indefinable; is not,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
strictly speaking, comprehensible. There is therefore
a difference between sovereignty and government.
Sovereignty ordains and establishes a form of government.
The form varies among different peoples and
at different times. The Constitution declares that
“The United States guarantees to every State in
this Union a republican form of government.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
This form, in America, is the creation, that is, the
creature, of the sovereign, the people. The essential
matter here is of powers and relations, and is made
clear by Chief Justice Marshall: The government of
the United States proceeds directly from the people;
is ordained and established in their name for definite
purposes declared in the Preamble to the Constitution,
and the assent of the States in their sovereign
capacity is implied in calling the Convention of 1787,
which framed the Constitution, and in submitting
that instrument to the people. The people were at
perfect liberty to accept or to reject it, and their act
was final. It required not the affirmance and could
not be negatived by the State governments. When
thus adopted, the Constitution was of complete
obligation, and bound the State sovereignties.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> But
had not the people of America, in 1787, already surrendered
all their powers to the State sovereignties
and had nothing more to give? The question whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
they may resume and modify the powers granted
to their government cannot be raised in this country.
The people always possess that power and since 1787
they have exercised it in making seventeen amendments
to the Constitution. The legitimacy of the
general government might be doubted had it been
created by the States, for the States, as governments,
are creations of the people, and possess only derivative
powers. “The powers delegated to the State
sovereignties were to be exercised by themselves, not
by a distinct and independent sovereignty created by
themselves.” The States were competent to form
a league, such as was the Confederation of 1781,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">but when “in order to form a more perfect Union” it
was deemed necessary to change this alliance into an
effective government, possessing great and sovereign
powers, and acting directly on the people, the necessity
of referring it to the people, and of deriving its powers
directly from them, was felt and acknowledged by all.
The government of the Union is emphatically and truly
a government of the people. In form and substance it
emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them
and are to be exercised directly on them, and for their
benefit. This government is acknowledged by all to be
one of enumerated powers. But the question respecting
the extent of the powers actually granted is perpetually
recurring, and will probably continue to arise as long as
our system shall exist. The government of the Union,
though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere
of action.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
This supremacy results from the nature of the
government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is the government of all; its powers are delegated by
all; it represents all, and acts for all. Though any one
State may be willing to control its operations, no State
is willing to allow others to control them. The nation, on
those subjects on which it can act, must necessarily bind
its component parts. But this question is not left to
mere reason; the people have in express terms decided
it by saying, this Constitution and the laws of the
United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof,
and all treaties made under its authority, shall be the
supreme law of the land, and by requiring executive,
legislative, judicial (and administrative) officers to
take the oath of fidelity to it.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p></blockquote>

<p>7. The question of sovereignty arises here and,
as commonly stated, of national sovereignty and of
State sovereignty. The equal vote allowed each
State by the Constitution,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> “is at once a recognition
of the portion of sovereignty remaining in the individual
States, and an instrument for preserving
that residuary sovereignty.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Are there two sovereignties
in America?</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The sovereignty of a State [declares Marshall], extends
to everything which exists by its authority, or is introduced
by its permission; but does not extend to these
means which are employed by Congress to carry into
execution powers conferred on that body by the people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
of the United States. These powers are not given by the
people of a single State, but by the people of the United
States to a government whose laws, made in pursuance of
the Constitution, are declared to be supreme. Consequently,
the people of a single State cannot confer a
sovereignty which will extend over them.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p></blockquote>

<p>8. The exercise of the taxing power illustrates the
principle here involved. The power of taxation residing
in a State measures the extent of sovereignty
which the people of a single State possess, and can
confer on its government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">We have a principle (here) [continues Marshall], which
leaves the power of taxing the people and property of a
State unimpaired; which leaves to a State the command
of all its resources, and which places beyond its reach all
these powers which are conferred by the people of the
United States on the government of the Union, and all
these means which are given for the purpose of carrying
these powers into execution. We have a principle which
is safe for the States and safe for the Union.... The
people of the United States did not design to make their
government dependent on the States. The government
of the Union possesses general powers of taxation....
The people of all the States and the States themselves are
represented in Congress, and by their representatives
exercise this power. When they tax the chartered institutions
of the States, they tax their constituents and
these taxes must be uniform.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> But when a State taxes
the operations of the government of the United States,
it acts upon institutions created not by their own constituents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
but by people over whom they claim no control.
It acts upon the measures of a government created by
others, as well as themselves; for the benefit of others in
common with themselves. The difference is that which
always exists, and always must exist, between the action
of the whole on a part, and the action of a part on the
whole, between the laws of a government declared to be
supreme, and these of a government which, when in
opposition to those laws, is not supreme.... In
America, the powers of sovereignty are divided between
the government of the Union and those of the States.
They are each sovereign with respect to the objects committed
to the other.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Plainly the essential matter here is one of functions.
Neither the government of the United States
nor that of a State is sovereign, for each possesses only
delegated powers. But the powers delegated to the
two governments are not for all purposes the same,
or of equal extent. The two governments have
different jurisdictions. Distinctively federal functions
are not State functions, as, for example, the
distinctively Federal functions of coining money,
making treaties, and declaring war.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> On the other
hand, distinctively State functions are the exercise
of the police power of the State,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> the control of intrastate
commerce, the power of extradition between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
States,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> the validity in a State of the public acts, records,
and judicial proceedings of another State<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> and
the right of citizens of each State to all privileges and
immunities of citizens in the several States.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>9. The question of the relative sovereignty of the
United States and that of a State is one of jurisdiction,
and is determined by extent of powers delegated,
not of original powers possessed. Delegated powers
are expressed in constitutions and laws. Two governments
exist in America: that of the Union and that
of the respective States. The Constitution of the
United States was ordained and established by the
people of the United States for themselves, for their
own government and not for the government of the
individual States.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> The constitution of a State is
made by the people of that State for themselves only.
Sovereignty in America has declared the Constitution
of the United States the supreme law of the land,
thus formally relegating State constitutions and laws
to inferior rank,—that is, to a position of powerlessness
when in conflict with the supreme law. Thus
when we speak of two “sovereignties,” or of “residuary
sovereignty,” we really mean “two governments
of delegated powers,”—that is, the State governments
and the national government. When we speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
of the two sovereignties, we do not mean <em>sovereignty</em>
(which is by nature indivisible), but <em>government</em>
(which is divisible), the creation of sovereignty and,
unlike sovereignty, possesses only delegated powers.</p>

<p>10. For administrative purposes, or, stating the
case in other words, for legal reasons and in harmony
with precedents in law, the terms “sovereignty” and
“residuary sovereignty” continue in use among
lawyers, judges, political writers, and civil officials;
but government is not, never was, and in such a
country as ours, never can be sovereignty. American
constitutional law is law made by authority of the
sovereign people: the law of the United States is made
by Congress, the authorized legislative agent of the
people of the United States: the law of the State, is
made by its Legislature, the authorized law-making
agent of the people of the State. The same essential
may be stated after the manner of Chief Justice
Marshall as the law of the whole: the Nation; the
law of the part, the State. Government is the child
of sovereignty.</p>

<p>11. Because of the sovereignty of the people of the
United States, and consequently, of the supremacy of
the Constitution, several results follow:</p>

<p>Madison expresses one of these in <cite>The Federalist</cite><a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The idea of a national government involves in it not only
an authority over the individual citizens, but an indefinite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
supremacy over all persons and things, so far as they
are objects of lawful government.</p></blockquote>

<p>Marshall expresses other <span class="locked">results,—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The general government, though limited as to its objects,
is supreme with respect to these objects. This principle
is a part of the Constitution. To this supreme government
ample powers are confided. With the ample
powers confided to this supreme government are connected
many express and important limitations on the
sovereignty of the States.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Hamilton, commenting on the Constitution, declares
that “the national and State systems are to
be regarded as one whole.”<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> And finally, although
our supreme law does not contain the word “sovereign,”
or “sovereignty,” it implies sovereignty.
The crowning illustration of this principle of implied
sovereignty grew out of the acquisition of Louisiana
in 1803. President Jefferson could find no provision
of the Constitution specifically empowering the
United States to make the acquisition, or to incorporate
the region into the United States. He therefore
proposed amending the Constitution so as to
authorize the purchase. The President’s doubts of
the power of the United States to acquire Louisiana
were weaker than his doubt of power to incorporate
the province into the United States,—that is, to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
a foreign province or provinces inhabited, by an alien
people, partakers in an American Commonwealth. He
consulted his Cabinet. Levi Lincoln, the Attorney-General,
was of opinion that to share the privileges
and immunities of the people of the United States
with a foreign population required the consent of the
people of the United States, and he suggested that if
a treaty of cession were made, containing such agreements,
it should be put in the form of a change of
boundaries instead of a cession, so as to bring the
territory within the United States. Albert Gallatin,
Secretary of Treasury, replied that to him it appeared:
(1) That the United States as a nation have an inherent
right to acquire territory; (2) That whenever
that acquisition is by treaty, the same constituted
authorities in which the treaty-making power is
vested have a constitutional right to sanction the
acquisition; and (3) That whenever the territory has
become acquired, Congress have the power either of
admitting it into the Union as a new State, or of
annexing it to a State, with the consent of that State,
or of making regulations for the government of such
territory.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Thus, according to Gallatin, the United
States, by its very nature, has the undoubted right
to acquire, to hold, and to govern territory as a
possession.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> Twenty-five years after the purchase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
of Louisiana, Chief Justice Marshall handed down
the decision of the Supreme Court, that “the Constitution
confers absolutely on the government of the
Union the powers of making war and of making
treaties; consequently that government possesses the
power of acquiring territory, either by conquest or
treaty.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> In this decision, Marshall reasons as did
Gallatin that a nation is by its very nature, sovereign,
and possesses the powers and functions of sovereignty.
When the American nation, a sovereign, created a
government of delegated powers, under the Constitution,
it delegated to that government powers
adequate to its purposes as a nation.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> The essential
purpose of sovereignty is to continue sovereign. The
word “sovereign” though not occurring in the
Constitution is necessarily implied as a permanent
quality or mark of the power that ordained and
established the Constitution. Sovereignty cannot be
delegated, but a supreme law, such as the Constitution,
necessarily implies a sovereignty that has
delegated the powers expressed or implied in the
Constitution itself. In other words, the Constitution
of the United States is the supreme law of the land
because the people of the United States are a sovereign.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
Sovereignty alone has original powers; all
others are delegated. Thus the Constitution itself
declares that “The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited
by it to the States, are reserved to the States
respectively, or to the people.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>12. American constitutional law is, therefore,
the authoritative formulation, in constitutional, or
statutory, or treaty form, of the will of the sovereign,
the people of the United States. This formulation
accords with the powers delegated by that sovereign.
The expression of this delegation of powers in the
conduct of the public business is government.
Therefore in America, government is another word
for the delegation of powers,—for limitations of
authority. Sovereignty is unlimited; government
is limited. The Constitution of the United States
is the supreme law of the land because through it the
people of the United States,—not the people of any
particular State or group of States,—have delegated
larger powers than have the people of any particular
State through its constitution. The whole is greater
than the part. “That the people have an original
right to establish for their future government such
principles as, in their opinion, shall most conduce to
their own happiness, is the basis on which the whole
American fabric has been erected.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> The exercise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
of this original right is an exercise of sovereignty.
The result of this exercise, in America, is the Constitution
of the United States which, this sovereignty
declares to be “the supreme law of the land.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_II" class="vspace">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS (1)</span></h2>
</div>

<p>13. The organization of the government of the
United States reflects the original and supreme will of
the people as they have seen fit to assign to different
departments of that government their respective
powers. “The powers of the Legislature are defined
and limited; and that these limits may not be mistaken,
the Constitution is written.”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> Thus the
Constitution declares that “all legislative powers
<em>herein granted</em>” are vested in Congress.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The inevitable
conclusion is “no grant, no power.” Congress
possesses only delegated powers. If an issue
arises under an act of Congress, there must ever be
the fundamental question of authority for the act.
This question of authority once settled, the act, by
the terms of the Constitution itself, is a part of the
supreme law.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Rarely is an act of Congress declared
unconstitutional. Legislative experience avoids
the enactment of laws whose constitutionality is
doubtful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
14. The general American doctrine is of the
separation of delegated powers, and is commonly
set forth in State constitutions.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Such separation
of powers is not expressly declared in the Constitution
of the United States; the principle here is of
limitation no further than is necessary for the protection
of each department of government. Fundamentally
it is a question of functions. Whatsoever
authority is necessary and proper for a department
of government to exercise, belongs to that department.
The separation of powers,—legislative,
executive, judicial,—is a matter of agreement or convention
made by the sovereign. Government is a
<em>unit</em>, not a tripartite machine or device. But in
order to administer government, and make it, as the
business man would say, “a going concern,” it is
conceived and organized into departments. Sovereignty
in America vests legislative power, so far as
the people of the United States have delegated that
power,—in Congress. The Constitution does not
specify all the powers so delegated. Such specification
is impossible. Such specification “could
scarcely be embraced by the human mind”; its details
“would partake of the prolixity of a legal code.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
The practical procedure is followed in the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
of selecting general—that is, large, comprehensive
powers, or groups of powers, and authorizing
Congress to exercise them. As a matter of practical
government, had the American people chosen to
declare in the Constitution that Congress shall have
power to make all laws necessary and proper
for the government of the United States, the grant
would be essentially the same as that made by naming
the powers of Congress in that instrument. The
powers delegated to Congress are mentioned chiefly
in the eighth section of the first article of the Constitution.
In other parts of the same article other
powers of Congress are declared, such as the power of
each House over its members; to choose a presiding
officer; the power of the Representatives to impeach;
of the Senators to convict,—or try impeachments,
and the respective powers of the Houses, under some
circumstances, to elect a Vice-President, or a President,—and
other powers, as of proposing amendments.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>15. The powers of Congress, delegated to it as a
whole, or to its respective Houses, and largely regulative
of congressional membership and procedure,
may be described as necessary parliamentary powers,
excepting the powers of the respective Houses in the
selection of President and Vice-President. Parliamentary
powers are functions essential to the
efficiency of a legislative body, and they were worked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
out, largely, before and during colonial times. Such
parliamentary functions were exercised by the
British Parliament and by State Legislatures prior
to the making of the Constitution. Indeed, the
provisions respecting such powers, in the State constitutions
from 1776 to 1787, were the immediate
precedents for them in the Constitution of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> But when we speak of the legislative
powers vested in Congress, we do not mean, commonly,
these strictly parliamentary powers; rather
do we mean another group or class of powers included
under such headings as “taxation,” “money,”
“commerce,” “banking,” “the army,” “the navy,”
“territory,” and others of notable rank. Such
powers as those indicate (or seem to indicate), a
larger delegation of authority to Congress than its
authority to regulate its membership. Whatever
may be thought of the relative rank of the powers of
Congress, all emanate from the same source, “the
people of the United States.”</p>

<p>16. In determining the nature and extent of these
powers, we are aided by the Constitution itself which
sets limitations. Thus,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout
the United States.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> The privilege of the writ of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
shall not be suspended unless when in cases of
rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
No bill of attainder or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i> law shall be passed.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>
No tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any
State.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> No preference shall be given by any regulation
of commerce or revenue to the ports of one State over
these of another; nor shall vessels bound to or from one
State be obliged to enter, clear, or pay duties in another.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
No money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence
of appropriations made by law; and a regular
statement and account of the receipts and expenditures
of all public money shall be published from time to time.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In addition to these limitations, there are limitations
set forth in the first ten, in the thirteenth, fourteenth,
and fifteenth amendments. These amendments, in
the aggregate, deny to Congress authority to violate
what we commonly designate as fundamental
rights. In other words, the people of the United
States have given Congress no power whatever to
imperil these rights: they are excepted out of the
government of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p>17. In the several States a like limitation of the
powers of the Legislature is made in the constitutions.
A typical statement of this limitation may be found
in the constitution of Pennsylvania, in the last clause
of the Declaration of Rights:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">To guard against transgressions of the high powers which
we (“the people of the Commonwealth”) have delegated,
we declare that everything in this article (“the Declaration
of Rights”) is excepted out of the general powers of
government and shall forever remain inviolate.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The discrimination here is between government and
sovereignty by means of a clear limitation or denial
of powers. Thus the carefully guarded fundamental
rights are sovereign, not governmental rights. That
the sovereign has the right or power to delegate any
of these fundamental rights, or the control over them
is a question in political science. That the sovereign,
in the modern republic, has not so delegated them,
is indisputable. Yet, in 1913 the people of the
United States ratified the Sixteenth Amendment,
namely, that “The Congress shall have power to lay
and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several
States and without regard to any census or enumeration.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
This amendment more nearly identifies
government with sovereignty than any other in the
Constitution. It removes limitations on the power
of Congress with respect to what is commonly called
“direct taxation.” It makes Congress practically
sovereign in its power to impose such taxation and to
collect such taxes. It does not require that direct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
taxes, like indirect taxes, shall be “uniform throughout
the United States.” It is the first departure in
America from the doctrine of limited government.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p>18. Of the powers delegated to Congress by the
American people it may be said that, save as excepted
by the silence of the Constitution, or by positive
limitation, they are universal and affirmative.
Their extent as well as their nature are made known
by interpretation,—that is, through the judiciary.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
Judicial interpretation must be distinguished from
economic, industrial, political, or even moral interpretation.
The Constitution provides only for
judicial interpretation.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The American people have
vested legislative powers in Congress, and the exercise
of them by Congress must be measured by the
terms of the grant.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Thus far the supreme test of
the constitutional exercise of these powers is to compare
the particular act of Congress with the Constitution.
Shall the act overrule the Constitution, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
shall the Constitution overrule the act? This is
the final test of congressional exercise of powers
delegated; it is the essential measure of federal legislation.
Practically it is congressional legislation
which, sooner or later, brings out clearly,—or at
least as clearly as the government of the United
States can bring out,—the real nature of that government.
Thus it is congressional legislation which, as
tested in the courts of law, brings into view the
implied and inherent powers of the federal government;
the relations of that government with the
States, and the powers of that government as to
territories and outlying possessions.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> So, too, it is
congressional legislation that determines the objects
and the extent of taxation, both direct and indirect;
that regulates commerce, coins money, and fixes its
value; affords equal protection to citizens, and
applies the police power of the United States. It is
congressional legislation which largely determines
the jurisdiction of federal courts and assigns duties
and powers to the President.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> In brief, the legislative
powers vested in Congress reflect the convictions
of the people of the United States of the eighteenth
century, when the trend of political thought was to
dethrone kings and to enthrone legislatures, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
basic regard for individualism. A like tendency and
regard are discernible in the State constitutions of
that period. The American people did not create
an omnipotent Congress, but they created a Congress
having few limitations and these they practically
nullified by the “sweeping clause” which empowers
Congress “to make all laws which shall be necessary
and proper for carrying into execution,” the powers
granted, “and all other powers vested by this Constitution
in the government of the United States,
or in any department or officer thereof.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>19. The phrase “necessary and proper” practically
includes all the purposes of government, and
these the Constitution itself sets forth, as</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="in0 in2 b0">
To form a more perfect Union,<br />
To establish justice,<br />
To insure domestic tranquillity,<br />
To provide for the common defense,<br />
To promote the general welfare,<br />
To secure the blessings of liberty
</p>

<p class="p0 in0">to themselves (“the people of the United States”) and their posterity.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This exercise of power by Congress is essentially
<em>political</em>, and Congress alone is judge of “the choice
of means and is empowered to use any means which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
are in fact conducive to the exercise of a power
granted by the Constitution.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> This conclusion is
inevitable. A legislative body could exist on no
other principle. Thus it follows that necessity is
supremacy, in the case of congressional legislation.
To any understanding of American constitutional
law, comprehension of this principle is fundamental.</p>

<p>20. May Congress abuse its powers? Possibly.
The remedy is through popular election of members
of either House, and repeal of the laws which—even
though their constitutionality be sustained by the
courts, may, in the judgment of the people, transcend
limits popularly supposed to be placed on Congress.
Thus there are two checks on congressional legislation:
the courts of law and the votes of the people.
It follows that the American sovereign—the people—may
by their votes approve or condemn congressional
legislation—approval or condemnation resulting in
a continuance or a change of membership of Congress,
in conformity to the relative strength of political
parties. It is here that part of the unwritten constitution
is disclosed. The written Constitution
contains no reference to political parties, but actual
government in the United States is by and through
political parties who, as organized agencies of the
public mind, give expression, in large measure, to the
unwritten constitution. Interpretation of the Constitution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
and of course, of the powers of Congress,
is largely interpretation by political parties.</p>

<p>21. Two interpretations of the Constitution have
evolved in America, the strict, or literal, commonly
called the Jeffersonian, and the liberal, or interpretation
according to the spirit of the Constitution,
commonly called the Hamiltonian. Chief Justice
Marshall was a disciple of Hamilton and enthroned
his ideas in the decisions of the Supreme Court for
thirty years, and these the first thirty years of the
existence of the Court. Later judges, whatever their
politics, have rarely departed from the course of interpretation
laid down by Marshall. To what extent the
political convictions of a judge determine his judicial
decisions, and to what extent party doctrines find
utterance in the decisions of courts of law are matters
of opinion quite as diverse as the men who hold them.
Yet, in order to understand American constitutional
law it is necessary also to be familiar with American
political and constitutional history. Without that history,
that law lacks background and circumstance.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>22. In attempting, then, to understand the legislation
of Congress, which is an exercise of delegated
powers, it is also necessary to know the history of the
times in which it was enacted. Thus the first ten<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
amendments were added in response to a quite
unanimous demand of the American people for what
they considered at the time, 1789, an adequate protection
of their fundamental rights. The Eleventh
Amendment of 1798 grew out of the unwillingness
of the people that a State should be made defendant
in a federal court at the suit of a citizen of another
State; therefore federal jurisdiction in such cases
was denied. The Twelfth Amendment of 1804 was
added to remedy a defect in the Constitution in the
method and procedure of choosing the President and
the Vice-President. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth,
and Fifteenth Amendments, of 1865, 1868, and 1870,
were added because of the negro race. The Sixteenth
and Seventeenth Amendments, of 1913, were added
after long agitation over direct taxation and the
popular election of senators of the United States, the
one essentially an economic, the other, a political
question. The history of the times records how these
amendments were brought about. So too does that
history largely explain the legislation enacted by
Congress by authority of these amendments.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>23. The essential fact as to the powers of Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
is of their limitation. Turning to the Constitution
itself, one will find that it devotes nearly three times
as much matter to legislative as to executive power;
and nearly eight times as much matter to legislative
as to judicial power. Doubtless this spatial
distribution of powers (or limitation of powers) tells
the whole story. Government is largely an affair
of legislation. Essentially, government is the public
business, controlled and administered for public or
general purposes. Government, in a republic, may be
said to express itself in laws. So important is this
expression of the will of the sovereign, constitutional
law consists almost wholly of the interpretation of legislation.
This means that the principles of government
are to be learned chiefly from the judicial decisions
in particular cases; and this again means that the particular
law having in due course come before the tribunal,
that law, when tested by the supreme law of the
land is sustained, or is declared to be without authority,—hence
it is unconstitutional. In the final test, all
legislation of Congress must stand the strain of this
question: By what authority is this law made? We
come then, sooner or later, in congressional legislation,
to the supreme law of the land and to sovereignty in
America,—“We, the people of the United States.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
24. It is a presumption of law, necessary in the
conduct of government, that all acts of Congress
are constitutional until pronounced unconstitutional
by a competent judicial tribunal. An issue arising
between parties involves a law. In deciding the
issue the tribunal decides as to the constitutionality
of the law, provided its constitutionality forms part
of the issue. Unless the issue of the constitutionality
arises and is before the tribunal, that body can make
no decision respecting the constitutionality of the
law. Thus whether or not the powers exercised by
Congress, as expressed in a piece of legislation—exceed
the powers granted to it by the Constitution is
a question which Congress itself is powerless to decide.
The Constitution itself does not so declare; on the
other hand it does not provide that Congress shall
be the final judge of its own powers. The principle
regulative of the exercise by Congress of powers
delegated to it is laid down by the Supreme Court:<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope
of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
which are plainly adapted to that end, which
are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and
spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_III" class="vspace">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF LEGISLATIVE POWERS (II)</span></h2>
</div>

<p>25. The powers of Congress, whether expressed or
implied, are powers incident to sovereignty, being
essential to the existence of the government which
sovereignty has created. The principle is laid down
in <cite>The Federalist</cite>, that the government of the Union
“must possess all the means and have a right to
resort to all the methods of executing the powers
with which it is intrusted.”<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The immediate comparison
here is between the government of the United
States and those of the States. The federal government
must possess powers as adequate for its purposes
as are the powers possessed and exercised by
the particular States. The principle is laid down
by Hamilton yet more explicitly:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">A government ought to contain in itself every power
requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed
to its care, and to the complete execution of the
trusts for which it is responsible, free from every other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
control but a regard for the public good and to the sense
of the people.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This principle applies to both American governments,—that
of each State, and that of the United
States. Each within its own jurisdiction is supreme.
This means that the national government possesses
powers adequate to the existence and efficient operation
of such a government. With this principle in
mind, the exercise, by Congress, of its powers becomes
reasonably plain. The people of the United States
are a sovereignty; they have ordained and established
the Constitution of the United States. This Constitution
is a plan of republican, that is of representative,
government. The powers granted by this
sovereignty to this government are adequate to the
ends and purposes of this government. Whence
follows all our constitutional law: for the constitutional
law of the States cannot vary essentially from
that of the United States. The principle here is
stated by Chief Justice Marshall: “The Constitution,
when thus adopted, was of complete obligation, and
bound the State sovereignties.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p>26. The powers of Congress are derived through
this Constitution and are adequate to the legislative
needs of the government thus created. Here again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
applies the principle as to proper legislative powers:
“Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope
of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which
are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and
spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional.” If this
principle be true (and it lies at the basis of government
in America), it seems unnecessary that the Constitution
should specify, or enumerate the powers of
Congress. These which are enumerated may not be
said to be in any logical order. Doubtless the qualities
of sovereignty are equal qualities—each essential
to the supreme end and purpose of sovereignty—which
end and purpose is to be and to remain
sovereignty.</p>

<p>27. But to Congress and to the State Legislatures
powers are granted. Does the grant of powers to
Congress extinguish the grant to the State Legislatures?
Here, again, Hamilton states the principle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">An entire consolidation of the States into one complete
sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the
parts; and whatever powers might remain in them, would
be altogether dependent on the general will. But as the
plan of the Convention (“of 1787”) aims only at a partial
union or consolidation, the State governments would
clearly retain all the rights of sovereignty which they
before had, and which were not, by that act, exclusively
delegated to the United States. This exclusive delegation,
or rather, this alienation, of State sovereignty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
would only exist in three cases: where the Constitution
in express terms granted an exclusive authority to the
Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to
the Union, and in another prohibited the States from
exercising the like authority; and where it granted an
authority to the Union, to which a similar authority in
the States would be absolutely and totally contradictory
and repugnant.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The implication of the extinguishment of the
powers of the State Legislature by the powers of
Congress can arise only where exercise of State authority
is “absolutely and totally contradictory and
repugnant to the power delegated to Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
Therefore “where the authority of the States is taken
away by <em>implication</em>, they may continue to act until
the United States exercise their power, because until
such exercise there can be no incompatibility.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
The principle here laid down is illustrated by laws
fixing the standard of weights and measures; bankruptcies;
counterfeiting the coin and securities of
the United States; copyrights and patent rights.
If Congress legislates on these subjects, such legislation
excludes State legislation in conflict with it.
In the absence of congressional and in the presence of
State legislation, on these (and some other subjects<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
falling in the same class) the respective State legislation
is supreme within the jurisdiction of the State.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
Stated in a different way, this principle of American
constitutional law would read,—the mere grant to the
federal government of power over a subject does not
necessarily extinguish State authority over the same
subject. Thus the State has power by common law,
or by statute, to fix a standard of weights and measures.
The issue here is not one merely of authority
but of relative authority. The exercise of authority
by Congress is not, by that fact, prohibition of exercise
of authority by a State. This exercise is radically
different from that of legislation on coining money,
making treaties, granting titles of nobility, issuing
letters of marque and reprisal,—or any other subject
over which Congress has exclusive, and a State no
jurisdiction. Here the question is one of exclusive,
or sole authority. Thus, State Legislatures have
authority to pass bankrupt or insolvent laws, provided
there is no act of Congress, on the subject, in
force establishing a uniform system of bankruptcy
conflicting with the State law, and, further, providing
that the State law does not impair the obligation of
contracts.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p>28. But State insolvent laws apply to contracts
within the State between one of its citizens and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
citizen of another State, and they do not apply to
contracts not made within the State. The principle
here is one of jurisdiction: no State has authority
outside its own jurisdiction. Therefore interstate
matters are beyond State jurisdiction and are exclusively
under the control of Congress. This principle
is expressed judicially: “Insolvent laws of one
State cannot discharge the contracts of citizens of
other States because they have no extra-territorial
operation.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>29. Congress exercises any of its powers as an
agent of its sovereign, the people of the United States.
These powers, like those of the President, or of the federal
courts, are expressed or implied; the government
of the United States is “a national government with
sovereign powers, legislative, executive, and judicial.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
Because this government is a sovereign government it
possesses the choice of means to make its sovereignty
real. Hence it possesses power to pay the debts of
the United States, to borrow money, to incorporate
banks, to coin money, to make war, and to do whatever
acts it considers necessary and proper, and in
such manner as it sees fit,—all acts of sovereignty.
It alone can determine what is a legal tender, what
the value of coins, domestic or foreign (within its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
jurisdiction) and, in brief it can do all acts such “as
accord with the usage of sovereign governments.”
Thus the national currency may be coin or paper, as
Congress shall regulate. Whatsoever Congress by
legislation declares to be a legal tender in payment of
debts between individuals or corporations is thereby
a legal tender, because Congress is “the legislature of
a sovereign nation” and is expressly empowered by
the Constitution to enact laws of the kind.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> This
power is commensurate with the jurisdiction of
Congress in this matter,—a power which absolutely
and totally excludes the power of the several States.</p>

<p>30. As a matter of constitutional law, it must be
admitted that, granting the national sovereignty of
the people of the United States, it must follow that
the legislature of this sovereign nation would possess
such power over currency and coinage. That is,
the power would be <em>implied</em> if it were not expressed.
It is the office or function of a supreme national
government to legislate for national ends and
purposes.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<p>But the principle of national sovereignty which
operates in Congressional legislation on money, currency,
coinage, and legal tenders, does not nullify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
the principle of contracts. A lawful contract between
parties that calls for payment of a particular
article with a particular article, be it silver coin, gold
coin, national bank notes, treasury notes, reserve
bank issues, or subsidiary coin, is satisfied only
when executed in the terms of the contract. The
obligation of the contract would be impaired if it
were executed otherwise than as the contract itself
sets forth.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>31. Congress is not under contract to coin money,
to pay the debts of the United States, or to borrow
money in any particular way. Duties, excises, and
imports must be <em>uniform</em> throughout the United
States, and this condition is a fundamental limitation.
No limitation is placed by the Constitution
on the power of Congress over the currency. This
power is supreme. It is a power which, duly exercised,
secures the existence of sovereignty itself.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
A function of sovereignty is performed in the issuing
of a bill of credit, the sovereign power thus pledging
its faith, and the thing issued is designed to
circulate as money. The State, or Commonwealth,
in the Union, is not a sovereign for this purpose, as
the Constitution provides.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> So when a State incorporates
a bank, which issues bills of credit, the act of
the bank is not an act of sovereignty, and the State,
though a stockholder in the bank, imparts none of its
sovereignty to the bank. The bank as a corporation,
not the State as an incorporator, is answerable for
the obligations of the bank.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> To constitute a “bill
of credit,” in the meaning of the Constitution, it must
be issued by a State, on the faith of the State and be
designed to circulate as money.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p>32. Power to provide for the punishment of
counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the
United States is specially delegated to Congress,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> but
it is not denied to the several States. The power to
coin money belongs exclusively to Congress<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> as a
mark and necessary incident of sovereignty, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
counterfeiting the coin constitutes an offense against
both the State and the United States. The uttering
of counterfeit coin is a cheat, and the State can protect
its citizens against fraud by exercise of its police
power. Such offenses fall strictly within State jurisdiction.
Counterfeiting debases the coin, throws
spurious and base metal, or false securities into circulation,
and is an offense against that constitutional
power which is exclusively authorized to create a
currency for public uses. The offense is against the
sovereignty of the nation, and, being a fraud, it is
against the sovereignty of the State. In either case
it imperils sovereignty.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>33. The power of Congress to establish post offices
and post roads is not an exclusive power, for the
States are not prohibited to legislate on the same
subject. But Congress has unlimited power over it
and may designate what may be included in and
what may be excluded from the mails. This exercise
is doubtless of the police power. It does not
follow that congressional establishing and regulation
of post offices and post roads mean that Congress
has power to deal with crime or immorality within a
State in order to maintain that it possesses the power
to forbid the use of the mails in aid of the perpetration
of crime and immorality. So a postal law of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Congress excluding lottery tickets from the mail is
not an abridgment of the freedom of the press.
Congress, by reason of the nature of its functions, is
empowered to determine what shall and what shall
not be carried in the mails, and the right of freedom
of speech does not give the right to injure the objects
or to defeat the purposes which government is ordained
and established to further and protect.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> But
the State, in exercise of its police power, may undoubtedly
protect its citizens from injury springing
out of that intercourse known as the mail service so
long as it is wholly intrastate,—that is, within its
jurisdiction.</p>

<p>34. Copyrights and patent rights are privileges
granted by Congress for a term of years and are
strictly statutory—for the United States has no
common law. The States may exercise their powers
in like manner, subject to the essential condition that
the Constitution is the supreme law of the land.
Copyrights and patent rights are examples of rights
which exist by act of Congress,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> but the right thus
created does not annul the ordinary police power as
put forth in the police regulations of a State. The
person owning or controlling either copyright or
patent right is not thereby empowered to defy the
laws of a State as respecting the sale of the article in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
which or over which he has the exclusive right. The
article itself may be adjudged injurious to the public
and, therefore, by police regulation, forbidden to be
sold or to be exposed for sale in the State. The
patent right prevents others than the inventor from
participating in the fruits of his invention, without
his consent; but the exercise of the right must be in
subordination to the police regulations of the State,
otherwise, “a person might with as much propriety
claim a right to commit murder with an instrument,
because he held a patent for a new and useful invention.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
It may be accepted as a principle that
“patent laws do not interfere with the power of a
State to pass laws for the protection and security of
its citizens, in their persons and property, or in respect
to matters of internal polity, although such laws
may incidentally affect the profitable use or sale by a
patentee of his inventions.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>35. The power of Congress, expressly delegated to
it, “to define and punish piracies and felonies committed
on the high seas, and offenses against the law
of nations,” is not exclusive. The States are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
prohibited from legislating on the subject. Offenses
committed within the jurisdiction of a State are
punishable by State laws. Such offenses are punishable
by common law. If there is no act of Congress
covering the offense, then the United States has not
assumed jurisdiction. But absence of a specific
mention or definition of the offense does not invalidate
a claim of jurisdiction when the result of the
offense is piracy. Piracy is robbery committed
within the jurisdiction of the admiralty,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> but an
offense that effects piracy, though not technically
robbery, is piracy.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> As piracy is an offence against
the law of nations, and not strictly against domestic
municipal law, it falls within the jurisdiction of the
admiralty—a jurisdiction over which the judicial
power of the United States is expressly extended
by the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> This jurisdiction is not exclusive
as provided for by the Constitution. Practically,
however, the States do not legislate on the
subject, unless it be to provide for the execution of
their police power over their own waters.</p>

<p>36. The “admiralty jurisdiction” of the United
States is co-extensive with its authority over or on
waters, fresh or salt, including the high seas, the
Great Lakes, and rivers and streams commerce over
which it has power to regulate. Thus this jurisdiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
is over the American ship wherever it may be.
“Offenses committed on vessels belonging to citizens
of the United States, within their admiralty jurisdiction
(‘that is within navigable waters’) though out
of the territorial limits of the United States, may be
judicially considered when the vessel and parties are
brought within their territorial jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<p>37. The war power is possessed by Congress
exclusively,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> for the limitation of the States as to
declaring war can be construed only as an exclusive
delegation of this power to the United States. The
exercise of this power is a sovereign act and may consist
in a formal declaration of war, or a formal recognition
or declaration of a state of war. War existing
by such regulation, the President, as commander-in-chief
of the army and navy, and of the militia of the
several States when called into the actual service of
the United States, is bound by his oath faithfully to
execute his office—which is to execute the laws of the
United States. It is for the President to determine
how to execute his office; that is a political, not a
judicial question. “He must determine what degree
of force the crisis demands.” He must decide the
character of the opposing forces, whether they are
belligerents, or of some other character. He may
close ports or declare a blockade of the enemy. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
possesses the whole executive power of the United
States. Ratification of his acts though <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i>
are constitutional,—fundamentally because sovereignty
having vested the executive office in a President,
and he having performed its duties to the best
of his ability, refusal to consider his acts as constitutional
would be repudiation by sovereignty of
an act which had been done by its authority.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p>

<p>38. The word “State” in the Constitution refers
to a State of the Union.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> For while the Constitution
was made, “ordained and established by the people
of the United States for themselves,”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> it was made
for the people of the United States in States. Thus it
follows that over a domain not constituting a State,
that is, over a domain consisting of a ceded district,
or a territory, or an outlying possession, Congress has
sole jurisdiction. Only the United States and the
several States possess sovereignty. No State, or a
member of the Union, has jurisdiction over the district
and there is no other American government
than Congress to exercise it. “Territory” like
property by common law must have an owner; if
it is self-owned and self-governed, it is sovereign;
otherwise it is a subject or possession of sovereignty.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
It follows, as to American constitutional law, that
subdivisions of States are wholly within State jurisdiction:
Congress having no jurisdiction over counties
or cities other than as, in a general way over
matters, Congressional legislation affects counties
and cities as parts of States throughout the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> And unless a State has ceded its jurisdiction
over a district within its borders, it has full authority
to levy taxes, to execute its inspection and other
police laws and regulations within that district.
Thus Kansas ceded the Ft. Leavenworth Military
Reservation to the United States in 1875, but the
deed of cession granted no more than use of the land
as a military post; the State, therefore, could levy and
collect taxes within this area, having never parted
with the sovereign right to do so.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> And any other
powers or rights of the State, over this area, not explicitly
granted to the United States by Kansas in
the deed of cession remain intact in the State; its
original jurisdiction as a State, save as explicitly
modified by that deed, remains.</p>

<p>39. The power of Congress to govern territory, implied
in the right to acquire it, and given to Congress in the
Constitution,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> to whatever other limitation it may be
subject, the extent of which must be decided as questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
arise, does not require that body to enact for ceded territory,
not made a part of the United States by Congressional
action, a system of laws which shall include the
right of trial by jury, and that the Constitution does
not, without legislation, and of its own force, carry such
right to territory so situated.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The principle laid down by the Supreme Court
recognizes two kinds or classes of ceded territory:
one, “made a part of the United States by congressional
action,” that is, incorporated into the United
States; the other, unincorporated. While congressional
authority over either class is supreme, when the
Constitution and laws of the United States are extended
by Congress over a territory, they cannot be
withdrawn,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> for if the Constitution could be withdrawn
directly it could be nullified indirectly by acts
passed inconsistent with it. The Constitution would
thus cease to exist as such and would become of no
greater authority than an ordinary act of Congress.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
The decision of the Court as to the power of Congress
over territory of the United States makes Congress
absolute in the exercise of its power. The Court does
enumerate the limitations on Congress, in such control,
but leaves each limitation to be determined as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
the issue involving it shall arise.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> The safeguard

the Court:</p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF TAXATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>40. In our system of government [observes the Supreme
Court], it is oftentimes difficult to fix the true
boundary between the two systems, State and federal
[and, adopting the words of Chief Justice Marshall, proceeds],—endeavoring
to fix this boundary upon the subject
of taxation, if we measure the power of taxation residing
in a State by the extent of sovereignty which the people
of a single State possess, and can confer on its government,—we
have an intelligible standard applicable to
every case to which the power may be applied. We
have a principle which leaves the power of taxing the
people and property unimpaired; which leaves to a State
the command of all its resources, and which places beyond
its reach all these powers which are conferred by the
people of the United States on the government of the
Union, and all these means which are given for the purpose
of carrying these powers into execution. We have
a principle which is safe for the States and safe for the
Union.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> We are relieved, as we ought to be, from clashing
sovereignty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
It follows that the powers and functions of the two
governments can be harmonized “only by a wise and
forbearing application of this principle.”<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<p>41. A tax is a burden or charge imposed by the
legislature on property or persons to raise money for
public purposes.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The two essentials of a good tax
are that it is to be laid for a public purpose and by
authority. The exercise of the taxing power not
only distinguishes sovereignty but also the government
which sovereignty creates by delegation of
power. But the State cannot exercise taxing power
beyond its jurisdiction,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> a limitation parallel to the
limitation of the sovereignty of the State, that is, a
version (however unphilosophical) of the idea in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
phrase “residuary sovereignty.”<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> But unless restrained
by the federal Constitution the power of
Congress as to mode, form, or extent of taxation is
unlimited.</p>

<p>The test here is jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Taxation is the
correlative of protection. As the State cannot protect
so it cannot tax beyond its jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Thus
the person or the property must be within the
jurisdiction of the State to bring either within its
taxing power. Tax laws can have no extra-territorial
operation,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> but there is no established limit of the
taxing power or to the selection of objects to which it
is applicable.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></p>

<p>42. A State Legislature may abuse this power, but
the Constitution of the United States was not intended
to furnish a corrective for every abuse of
power committed by the State governments. Relief
lies wholly with the electors within the State who,
if the State constitution does not afford security
against unjust taxation and unwise legislation, can
both alter the State constitution and elect other
legislators.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span></p><blockquote>

<p class="in0">So long as the State by its laws, prescribing the mode and
subjects of taxation, does not entrench upon the legitimate
authority of the Union, or violate any right recognized,
or secured by the Constitution of the United States,
the (Supreme) Court, as between the State and its citizens,
can afford no relief against State taxation, however
unjust, oppressive, or onerous.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The discretion of the State,—that is, of the State
Legislature, is beyond the power of the federal
government, or any of its departments, to supervise
or control.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>43. The fundamental idea in America is that each
government—the State, the national—possesses powers
and functions adequate to its own ends and purposes.
Thus the State has no power to lay a tax on
any constitutional means employed by the government
of the Union to execute its powers, otherwise, by
taxation of such means or agencies,—say the mail, the
mint, judicial process, patent rights,—the States
might defeat all the ends of the national government,—a
design not intended by the people of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> But this protection of government
is not limited to the United States by limiting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
States; it applies to the States as limiting the United
States.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The sovereign powers vested in the State governments by
their respective constitutions, remain unaltered and unimpaired,
except so far as they were granted to the
government of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> As the powers not
delegated were reserved to the States respectively, or
to the people, the government of the United States can
claim no powers not so delegated, and the powers actually
granted must be such as are expressly given, or given by
necessary implication.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our complex system, the existence of the
States in their separate and independent condition</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">is so indispensable, that without them the general government
itself would disappear from the family of nations.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
Whence the necessary conclusion that the means and
instrumentalities employed for carrying on the operations
of their governments (the State governments), for
preserving their existence, and fulfilling the high and responsible
duties assigned to them in the Constitution,
should be left free and unimpaired, should not be liable
to be crippled, much less defeated by the taxing power
of another government, which power acknowledges no
limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the
tax, and more especially, those means and instrumentalities
which are the creation of their sovereign and reserved
rights, one of which is the establishment of the
judicial department, and the appointing of officers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
administer the laws. Without this power and the exercise
of it, no one of the States, under the form of government
guaranteed by the Constitution, could long
preserve its existence.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p></blockquote>

<p>44. One of the reserved powers of the States was
to establish a judicial department.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">All of the thirteen States were in possession of this power,
and had exercised it at the adoption of the Constitution;
and it is not pretended that any grant of it to the general
government is found in that instrument. It is therefore
one of the sovereign powers vested in the States by their
constitutions, which remained unaltered and unimpaired,
and in respect to which the State is as independent of the
general government as that government is independent
of the States. In respect to reserved powers, the
State is as sovereign and as independent as the general
government.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The means and instrumentalities employed by the
one government to carry its powers into operation are
as necessary to its self-preservation as the means and
instrumentalities are necessary to the other. Unimpaired
existence is as essential to the one as to the
other. There is no express provision in the Constitution
that prohibits the general government from
taxing the means and instrumentalities of the States,
or prohibiting such taxation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">In both cases the exemption rests upon necessary implication,
and is upheld by the great law of self-preservation;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
as any government whose means employed in conducting
its operations, if subject to the control of another and
distinct government, can exist only at the mercy of that
government.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p></blockquote>

<p>45. This was the constitutional law of the United
States as settled in 1870,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> the case arising in Massachusetts;
the plaintiff a judicial officer of that Commonwealth
having brought suit to recover from the
United States Revenue Collector the amount of income
tax exacted from him, it being part of his salary
as a judge in that Commonwealth. The Supreme
Court of the United States sustained the plaintiff
for reasons given in the opinion, part of which has
been quoted. By parity of reasoning, as followed in
that decision, any act of Congress imposing a tax on
the salary of any State officer, if his office is a means
and instrumentality employed by the State to carry
its powers into operation must be declared unconstitutional.
In 1913 the Constitution was amended
so that “The Congress shall have power to lay
and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source
derived, without apportionment among the several
States, and without regard to any census or
enumeration.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Does this amendment increase the taxing power of
Congress beyond that power as possessed prior to
1913 and as limited by the Supreme Court in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
decision in the case of The Collector <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Day? If any
officer of a State, executive, legislative, judicial, or
administrative, receives a salary, large or small,
(and it forms part of his income) is it beyond the
jurisdiction of the United States as a taxable estate,
despite the explicit power of Congress, in this Sixteenth
Amendment “to lay and collect taxes on incomes,
from whatever source derived?” Does the
amendment overrule the decision in The Collector <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr>
Day?<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> Evidently the amendment empowers Congress
to levy an income tax wholly in disregard of the
effect of the tax in impairing the “necessary means
and instrumentalities of a State.” Here too the issue
is one of jurisdiction. The person taxed being within
the jurisdiction of the United States has no redress
against that jurisdiction more than has a person,
taxed and being within the jurisdiction of a State,
redress against the State. But can the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, or any other State, imposing
an income tax, lay and collect it from whatever
source derived, and that source be the treasury of the
United States,—that income be salary received by a
citizen of the State who also is a federal official, say
a federal Judge, or a Collector of the Revenue, or a
United States Marshal, or a Senator of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
States, or a Congressman, or the President of the
United States?<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>46. In the operations of government, the delegation
of authority by the executive, the legislative,
or the judiciary is rare. The constitutional test,
in either case, is purpose and authority. Thus a
municipal corporation is a representative not only of
the State, but is a portion of its governmental power.
It is one of its creatures, made for a specific purpose,
to exercise within a limited sphere the powers of
the State. “The action is no less a portion of the
sovereign authority when it is done through the
agency of a town or city corporation.”<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Thus a tax
authorized by the State Legislature, to be imposed by
a municipal corporation is a good tax in law, provided
it is for a public purpose. This is not a delegation of
the taxing power, but is the exercise of it by the Legislature.
The municipality itself has no power to tax,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
or even to be a municipality, save by authority of the
State, usually by the constitution, vested in its Legislature.
The amount of the tax, the subjects of
taxation, the method of assessment and of collection
are wholly within the discretion of the Legislature.
The exemption of churches, schools, colleges, and
charitable institutions may or may not be required
by a State constitution. If this is silent on the subject,
the question is wholly one of legislative discretion.
A charitable institution has no fundamental
right to exemption from taxation, as a person has a
fundamental right to “due process of law.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> The
principle of exemption from taxation is that taxation
of the person or the property tends to destroy the
powers or to impair the efficiency of the State.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<p>47. A tax must not only be laid by authority but
it must be for a public purpose. Thus any assessment
imposed upon persons or property by the government,
State or federal, for the gain, emolument,
or advantage of a private person, or an official, is unconstitutional.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
The purpose must be public, as for
example, for schools, highways, canals, public buildings,
markets, asylums, jails, or to keep the same in
repair and to use them for public purposes. The Legislature
cannot authorize a town or a county, or any
subdivision of the State, to raise money for other than
public purposes and uses. It cannot confer benefits
on individuals, however meritorious, by taxation.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>48. Taxes, imposed under the Constitution, have
been classed as direct or indirect,—the direct being
apportionable among the States according to population;
the indirect being uniform throughout the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>The Sixteenth Amendment of 1913 abolishes the
limitation of apportionment or enumeration in the
imposition and collection of an income tax. The
Income Tax law of October 3, 1913—the first of the
kind enacted by Congress under the amendment—exempted
incomes of $3000, or less, or $4000, or less,
as the person taxed may be single or married. The
amount of the exemption is fixed at the discretion of
Congress. So too is the rate of taxation by duties,
imposts, and excises, as well as the inclusion or exclusion
of articles subject to them, but Congress must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
make such taxes uniform throughout the United
States.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<p>The taxing power may be used to encourage or to
discourage an activity, or to destroy it. As thus
used, the exercise of the taxing power, whether by the
State or by the United States, may characterize the
policy, or administration of its government. So
too if a State engages in manufacturing, or in any
activity or occupation taxable under federal revenue
laws, it is amenable in taxes like a private person.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF COMMERCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>49. The power to regulate commerce belongs to
sovereignty. By the Constitution Congress is empowered
“to regulate commerce with foreign nations,
and among the several States, and with the Indian
tribes.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> The principle of this regulation, or of the
exercise of the power, is essentially that of taxation:
it is a matter of jurisdiction. “The power of Congress
to regulate commerce,” observes Chief Justice Marshall,
in the first American judicial decision on the
subject, “comprehends and warrants every act of
national sovereignty which any other sovereign
nation may exercise.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<p>The enormous powers Congress wields through this
clause cannot be fully defined. The Supreme Court
has not defined them. Like sovereignty itself, the
exercise of its essential powers, even when delegated
functionally in government, does not yield to the
limits of definition. The decisions of the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Court are not definitions of the power over commerce
so much as they are definitions of the particular
exercise of the power of Congress within its jurisdiction,
with respect to commerce, by the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
For the States also have jurisdiction over commerce.
Our knowledge of the boundaries of these two jurisdictions
arises from the conflict of laws concerning
them.</p>

<p>50. In defining national jurisdiction and State
jurisdiction over commerce, two propositions are
fundamental:</p>

<p>(1) The Constitution of the United States is the
supreme law of the land.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>(2) It is the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>It should be clearly understood that power to
regulate commerce is incident to sovereignty. Government—whatever
its form—is a delegation of power
by sovereignty, and of necessity possesses this power
of regulation. The degree or extent of the delegation
of the power to regulate commerce marks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
unmistakably the jurisdiction of the government exercising
the power. The analogy is in the taxing
power. In our system of dual government—national
and State—there are two jurisdictions. The respective
States have power over commerce; the United
States has power to regulate commerce,—each
jurisdiction expressly or impliedly outlined by the
Constitution.</p>

<p>51. With slight change in wording, the leading
decisions of the Supreme Court on the power of the
United States to lay and collect taxes, and its decisions
on the subject interpretative of the taxing power
of the States, apply, in principle, to their respective
powers over commerce:</p>

execution. We have a principle which is safe for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>

ought to be, from clashing sovereignty; from interfering
powers.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p>52. No evil contributed more to the feebleness of
the old Confederation than its inability to regulate
commerce. The mischief being great, the grant of
power to correct the mischief was correspondingly
great. This grant of power to regulate commerce
comprehends “all foreign commerce and all commerce
among the States.” As inefficiency was the evil,
the grant of power was to secure efficiency. In
construing this grant—the commerce clause of the
Constitution—the large and single purpose is so to
construe as not to impair its efficiency and thus defeat
the object of the grant.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>The commerce clause has become the authority
for exercising the enormous powers of the national
government as is illustrated, possibly, by the exercise
of power under no other clause. This means
that the United States in exercising this delegated
power exercises so vast a power that it seems to be
sovereignty itself. Vast as this power is—and practically
it is incommensurable—it is a delegated, not
an original power of the national government. The
scope, purpose, and nature of this national power to
regulate commerce are indicated by the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Court in its construction of the commerce clause.
Here as in the exercise of the taxing power the test
is jurisdiction. The essential question is, What is
the jurisdiction of the United States, what that of the
respective States over commerce?</p>

<p>53. Commerce is intercourse,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and comprehends
traffic, navigation, telegraphic intercommunication,
and consequently, communication by telephone, wireless,
or signals.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>The Constitution empowers Congress to regulate
commerce “among the several States,” an expression
which excludes “the completely interior traffic of a
State.” This completely internal commerce is reserved
for the State itself. To whatsoever extent
the foreign or interstate commerce of the United
States penetrates a State, it is subject to regulation
by the United States; it is carried on within national
jurisdiction. The power of Congress to regulate
commerce within this jurisdiction is complete in itself
and knows no limitations other than these prescribed
in the Constitution. Thus this power to regulate
commerce, though limited to commerce with foreign
nations and among the States, and with the Indian
tribes, is plenary as to these objects, and Congress
in exercising this power is commonly spoken of as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
“sovereign.”<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> It follows, that as the Constitution
is the supreme law of the land, and the Supreme
Court has power to say what the law is—State laws
to regulate commerce, in conflict with national laws,
are unconstitutional. The essential issue, in such
conflict, is one of jurisdiction. And here, the real
question is whether the regulation of commerce by a
State is essential to its existence as a State, or regulation
by the United States is essential to its existence
as the United States. Such regulation by a State is
known as the exercise of the police power.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>But the United States also possesses police power.
The line of demarcation between the State and the
national police power follows closely, if not precisely,
the line of demarcation between State power and
national power to regulate commerce.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> The State
has power to protect itself,—that is, to guard its
people against contagious or infectious diseases, as
is exemplified in laws for the inspection of foods, for
forbidding the pollution of streams, for securing the
accuracy of weights and measures, the peace and good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
order of communities, the comfort of the inhabitants,—and,
in a word,—to exercise such authority as, were
no such authority exercised, the State would cease
being the State.</p>

<p>54. The power granted to Congress to regulate
commerce is not a power granted to the States; it
pertains to the United States only. Therefore Congress
has no power to regulate commerce that is not
“with foreign nations, and among the several States,
and with the Indian tribes.” Practically this deprives
the State of police power over foreign and interstate
commerce, and deprives the United States
of police power over commerce that is, as to the State,
completely internal. To what extent a State can
protect itself from the entrance of paupers, insane or
diseased persons, is a question for determination by
the Courts. If such persons are “commerce” their
entrance is a matter within the jurisdiction of Congress.
But the welfare of the people of the United
States is essentially the welfare of the people of the
States, and Congress, in considering that welfare,
avoids possible conflict with State legislation. Thus
the immigration laws—all of which are national—include,
or seek to include, these provisions for
inspection which a State would prescribe, in the
exercise of its police power for the health, safety,
and general welfare of its own citizens. But here,
too, a dominant principle prevails;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The government of the United States, within the scope of
its powers, operates upon every foot of territory under its
jurisdiction. It legislates for the whole nation, and is
not embarrassed by State lines. Its peculiar duty is to
protect one part of the country from encroachments by
another upon the national rights which belong to all.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Tested by this principle, any State laws conflicting
with national immigration laws are unconstitutional.</p>

<p>55. The power to regulate commerce among the
several States extends to commercial highways and
to agencies employed in such commerce. Thus
waterways capable of navigation and the free and
unobstructed use of them are subjects of congressional
legislation under the commerce clause. From
this it follows that Congress legislates concerning
these waterways, their protection, their dredging,
the bridges that cross them, the boats that navigate
them, the form, size, construction, command, and
equipment of these boats, the inspection of boilers,
the licensing of officers,—indeed, concerning navigation
in its broadest application under the commerce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
clause. Vessels engaged in such commerce are described
as “the public property of the nation, and
subject to all the requisite legislation of Congress.”<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<p>56. In like manner, the national power to regulate
commerce extends over interstate commerce when
carried on by land transportation. Thus cars on
railroads used in interstate commerce must be
equipped with automatic couplers and continuous
brakes, and locomotives with driving-wheel brakes.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>To what length this regulation of commerce may
be carried by Congress is unknown, nor can it be
determined in advance. The limitations, if any, are
of expediency.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> Thus in exercise of this vast power
Congress may regulate hours of labor, wages, selection
and use of material in construction of vehicles
engaged in such commerce; the education, training,
and conduct of persons engaged in handling such
commerce; the age of employment; and physical
equipment for the welfare of employees, as well as
tariff rates and other incidents.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
57. But in the exercise of this power to regulate
commerce Congress has legislated “to protect trade
and commerce against unlawful restraints and
monopolies.”<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Individuals, or corporations under
State laws, engaged in business, in so far as they are
contracts, combinations in the form of trusts, or
otherwise, or conspiracies in restraint of trade or
commerce among the several States are illegal. The
test here is, Are such combinations in restraint of
commerce among the several States, or with foreign
nations, or with the Indian tribes? If any such combination
be in restraint of commerce completely
internal in a State, it does not fall within the jurisdiction
of the United States. If illegal, it is illegal
by State laws.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Thus a combination that is engaged
in manufacturing is within the jurisdiction of the
police power of the State, not within the jurisdiction
given by the commerce clause of the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>
The regulation of manufactures is not the regulation
of commerce. A monopoly of manufacturing is not
necessarily a monopoly of commerce among the
several States. In other words, manufacturing is
not commerce. The Constitution does not give
Congress power to regulate manufactures. However,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
as soon as the article manufactured becomes
an article of commerce among the several States,
then it is subject to regulation by Congress.</p>

<p>58. As soon as the article is manufactured it is
subject to the law of the State; the moment the article
commences its final movement from the State of its
origin, that moment it is an article of commerce as
that word is used in the Constitution, and is within
the jurisdiction of Congress.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Manufacture is transformation,—the fashioning of raw
materials into a change of form for use. The functions
of commerce are different. The buying and selling and
the transportation incidental thereto constitute commerce;
and the regulation of commerce in the constitutional
sense, embraces the regulation at least of such
transportation. If it be held that the term includes the
regulation of all such manufactures as are intended to be
the subjects of commercial transactions in the future, it
is impossible to deny that it would also include all productive
industries that contemplate the same thing.
The result would be that Congress would be invested, to
the exclusion of the States, with the power to regulate,
not only manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture,
stock-raising, domestic fisheries, mining,—in short, every
branch of human industry.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Assumption of power such as this by Congress would
conflict with the residuary powers of the States,—powers
over intrastate commerce, and that vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
authority possessed by the States and known as their
police powers. Were such authority possessed and
exercised by Congress, the State governments would
be paralyzed and between the States and the United
States there would be endless conflict.</p>

<p>59. It is not the delegation to Congress of power
to regulate commerce that makes the exercise of a
similar power by the State void; it is the actual exercise
by Congress of its power to regulate commerce
that works the prohibition. In the absence of congressional
legislation on the subject the State may
legislate. Thus a State law for the regulation of
pilots and pilotage, in the absence of Federal law for
the same, is valid.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> This means that sovereignty
acting through the State government controls—or
has jurisdiction—unless sovereignty has acted in the
matter through the government of the United States.
Thus, where the subject, say a bridge, a wharf, or a
stream, over which power may be exercised, is local in
its nature and operation, or constitutes a mere aid
to commerce, the authority of the State may be exerted
for its regulation and management until Congress
interferes and supersedes State action.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<p>But a license fee exacted by a State law, from a
vessel engaged in commerce is a tax for the use of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
navigable waters and not a charge in the nature of
compensation for any specific improvement, or use
of wharves. It is a burden on commerce and is a
State regulation of commerce in conflict with the
power of Congress to regulate it and therefore unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
But the internal commerce of a
State, that is, the commerce that is wholly confined
within its limits is as much under its control as foreign
or interstate commerce is under the control of the
general government.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>60. By the words “taxation of commerce” is
understood the taxation of the agency, means, instrument,
vehicle, or article in such a way or with
such effect as to control commerce; and by “control”
is understood any degree of control. If the State
can tax foreign or interstate commerce lightly, it can
tax it heavily, and if heavily, it can so tax as to
destroy commerce. So long as the article imported
remains in the original form of package, the property
of the importer, in his warehouse, it is within the jurisdiction
of the United States; but as soon as it has
become incorporated and mixed with the mass of
property in the State, it is within the jurisdiction of
the State and becomes subject to its taxing power.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>Were the State to tax the importer as such, this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
would be a tax on importation and beyond State
jurisdiction. So too would be any charges, imposed
by the State, on the introduction or incorporation
of the imported article into and with the mass of
property in the State. The essential principle here
is that the taxing power of the State cannot reach and
restrain the action of the national government within
its proper sphere. “It cannot interfere with any
regulation of commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p>61. The object in delegating to Congress the
power to regulate commerce—a delegation without
limitations—was to insure uniformity against discriminating
State legislation.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> The large and fundamental
purposes of the people of the United States in
establishing a national government are cited in the
Preamble to the Constitution. Unless the power to
regulate commerce with foreign nations and among
the several States was delegated to Congress, these
fundamental purposes could not be realized.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> It is
a nice question: When has the commercial power of
the United States over a commodity ceased and the
power of the State commenced? The Supreme Court
answers: The federal commercial power continues
until the commodity has ceased to be the subject of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
discriminating legislation by reason of its foreign
character. That power protects it even after it has
entered the State from any burdens imposed by
reason of its foreign origin.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> Any article brought
into a State, as an article of commerce, from another
State,—that is from another political jurisdiction
possesses “foreign character.” The principle involved
here may thus be stated: (1) The Constitution
having given Congress power to regulate commerce
with foreign nations and among the several States,
that power is necessarily exclusive whenever the subjects
of it are national in their character, or admit
only of one uniform system, or plan of regulation.
(2) Where the power to regulate is exclusively in
Congress, the failure of Congress to make express
regulations indicates its will that the subject shall be
left free from any restrictions or impositions; and
any regulation of the subject by the States, except
only in matters of local concern, is repugnant to such
freedom. (3) The only way in which commerce
between the States can be legitimately affected by
State laws is when, by virtue of its police power,
and by its jurisdiction over persons and property
within its limits, a State provides for the security of
the lives, limbs, health, and comfort of persons and
the protection of property. But these police regulations,
affecting commerce only incidentally,—such as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
(for example) the establishment and regulation of
highways, canals, railroads, and wharves by taxation
as forming part of the mass of property within the
State,—must be strictly internal regulations, not imposing
taxes on persons or property passing through
the State, or coming into it for a temporary purpose
and forming no part of the common mass of property
within its jurisdiction. Any State regulation which
discriminates adversely to the persons or property
of other States is an unauthorized interference with
the power of Congress over the subject.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p>62. Interstate commerce cannot be taxed by the
State even though the same amount of tax should be
laid by the State on commerce carried on wholly
within its limits.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> The right involved is not a State
right. “To carry on interstate commerce is not a
franchise or privilege granted by the State; it is a
right which every citizen of the United States is
entitled to exercise under the Constitution and laws
of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> That persons engaged in
such commerce are incorporated under the laws of a
State and thereby possess facilities for carrying on
their business cannot deprive them of their fundamental
right as against the State, but Congress, by
its power to regulate commerce, may prescribe conditions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
under which their business is carried on,
or by regulation, destroy their business entirely.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>
Thus a State cannot, by a license tax, exclude from
its jurisdiction a foreign corporation engaged in
interstate commerce, or impose any burdens upon
such commerce within its limits.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> But it is within
the police power of a State to protect the lives and
health of its people, and to protect property through
laws suppressing nuisances; prohibiting manufactures
injurious to the public health; prohibiting the
manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors; prohibiting
lotteries, gambling, horse-racing, or anything
else which the Legislature considers opposed to
the public welfare.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> A local regulation limiting the
speed of trains on entering a town or city, or
approaching a curve or a bridge, or requiring a train
to stop at a particular place, comes within the exercise
of the police power of the State.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>63. The power of a State over commerce being
exclusive only as to commerce strictly internal and
within its own boundaries,—that is, within its own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
jurisdiction,—it follows that “a State can no more
regulate or impede commerce among the several
States than it can regulate or impede commerce
with foreign nations.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> Taxation, by a State, of
goods coming into it from another State, would
destroy freedom of trade within the nation, which
Congress has seen fit shall remain undisturbed.
This freedom of trade is national in character,
and interference with it, by a State, would violate
a function and defeat the purpose of nationality:
that is, such violation would prevent the people
of the United States from realizing their own
sovereignty.</p>

<p>64. An illustration of the constitutional use of the
power of the State over commerce is afforded by the
tax, in Texas, on telegraph messages sent from one
place to another exclusively within the State, by
private parties, and not by the agents of the government
of the United States. The Texas law imposing
this tax is not in conflict with the power of Congress
to regulate commerce,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> and therefore was not repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States.
The line of demarcation as to exercise of the police
power by a State is drawn “by the undoubted right
of the States of the Union to control their purely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
internal affairs, in doing which they exercise powers
not surrendered to the general government.”<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<p>Many State laws regulating its administration of
internal affairs are applications of its police power.
The police power of the State is of right, and is
founded on “the sacred law of self-defense.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> But
this sacred law applies strictly to the domain of the
State—to its own jurisdiction. “It cannot invade
the domain of the national government.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> A State
inspection law is a familiar example of the exercise of
its police power, but such a law, working obstruction
of interstate commerce, or any limitation of it, though
such effect be only incidental, is repugnant to the
Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Such repugnancy is effected by a
State law levying a tax on tonnage, and is void.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
But a charge for mooring or landing at a wharf, is
not a tax on tonnage, but a charge for services
rendered;<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> neither is the tax a tonnage tax when
the State imposes a tax on vessels (even if regularly
engaged in interstate commerce), the property of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
persons residing within the jurisdiction of the State,
the vessels themselves being part of the mass of
property within the State, being moored for long
periods at the wharf for repairs and being under
the protection of the State. The taxing power is a
distinct and separate power from the power to
regulate commerce. The right of taxation in a State
remains over every subject where it existed before
the adoption of the Constitution with the exception
only of prohibitions expressed or implied in the
Constitution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The sovereign jurisdiction of the State is not limited;
within that jurisdiction it is free to tax. But the powers
to tax and to prohibit taxation are given in the Constitution
by separate clauses, and these powers are separate
and distinct from the power to regulate commerce.
From this it follows that the enrolment of a ship or vessel
in interstate commerce does not exempt its owner from
taxation for his interest in it as property, upon a valuation
by State law, as in the case of other personal
property.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p></blockquote>

<p>65. There ever remains the question of the extent
of the power of Congress to regulate commerce.
American constitutional law as to commerce is largely
of what the States may not do. But the enormous
power of Congress to regulate commerce, more and
more as the years pass,—as the meaning of “national
jurisdiction” is defined by the courts of law,—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
definition, however, slowly conforming to public
opinion,—discloses the extent of the federal power
through the commerce clause. Doubtless Congress
has made but a beginning in its exercise of this
power. Thus it has made lottery tickets articles of
commerce, has excluded them from the mails, has
assumed plenary authority of the carriage of such
articles from State to State, and, by authority of the
commerce clause has practically destroyed the lottery
business in the United States.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> The principle here
decided is that, under the power to regulate commerce,
regulation may take the form of prohibition,
and that the power “may be exerted with the
effect of excluding particular articles from such
commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>In this decision the Court observes, “that the suppression
of nuisances injurious to public health or
morality is among the most important duties of
government,” and quotes an earlier decision as to
“the widespread pestilence of lotteries.” It might
seem that while exercising its powers under the commerce
clause Congress was really exercising the police
power of the United States.</p>

<p>66. Of highest importance is the act of Congress
of July 2, 1890, and later amendments, known as the
Anti-Trust Act, entitled, An “Act to Protect Trade
and Commerce against Unlawful Restraints and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
Monopolies.” The decisions growing out of this
act have been made on issues involving the particular
questions whether or not restraints and monopolies
so-called were such under the act and conflicted with
it. The power of Congress, under the commerce
clause to prohibit such restraints and monopolies
has not been denied. It will be remembered that
power to regulate commerce is not power to regulate
manufactures. The purpose of the Anti-Trust law<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>
is “to destroy the power to place any direct restraint
on interstate trade or commerce, when by any combination
or conspiracy formed by either natural or
artificial persons, such a power has been acquired;
and the government may intervene and demand relief
as well after the combination is fully organized
as while it is in process of formation.”<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> The principle
involved here is as to the power of corporations organized
under State laws to restrain or to monopolize
interstate commerce. The State has no power to
create corporations with such powers, and consequently
they cannot exercise them lawfully. And
like attempts to restrain and monopolize interstate
commerce made by individuals is alike unlawful.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>67. So, too, where a labor organization sought by
a boycott to prevent the manufacture of articles intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
for interstate commerce, and to prevent the
re-selling of these articles in other States, the combination
and plan were held to be restraint of commerce
and in violation of the Anti-Trust act.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> The
cases strongly suggest that federal laws to regulate
commerce may be essentially police regulations as,
notably, laws requiring safety appliances on railroad
trains and steamboats; laws regulating hours of
labor and child labor; laws requiring arbitration
of controversies between employers and employees
operating in interstate commerce; the pure food law;
the exclusion of lottery tickets from the mails, and
the like. The Constitution contains no clause explicitly
delegating the police power to the United
States, and the exercise of police power by Congress
has thus far been quite without exception under the
commerce clause. Yet by parity of reasoning, the
police power may be included under the power to
declare war.</p>

<p>68. There is such a thing as the peace of the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> The enormous power of Congress
under the commerce clause has undoubtedly promoted
that peace: “domestic tranquillity” is one of
the specified purposes in ordaining and establishing
the Constitution. As absence of power to regulate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
commerce marked the weakness of the Articles of
Confederation, so the special inclusion of that power
among those delegated to Congress marks the
strength of the Constitution.</p>

<p>69. Within their respective jurisdictions the
United States and the several States have power to
regulate commerce. The power over commerce, in
either jurisdiction, is exercisable within the principle
of self-preservation. Whatsoever exercise of this
power is essential to the existence of either government
belongs to that government and cannot be repugnant
to the other, that is, under the dual system
of American constitutional government. Simple as
this principle may seem, its practical application
in defining the two jurisdictions, or the authority of
either government, involves all the issues in American
constitutional law, and the decisions of the American
judiciary in cases arising under the commerce clause
of the Constitution.</p>

<p>A notable instance of the authority given by the
commerce clause is the power of Congress, over the
transportation of the mails, to prevent “any unlawful
and forcible interference” with them. “The
strong arm of the government may be put forth to
brush away all obstructions to the freedom of interstate
commerce or the transportation of the mails”;
“the United States have a property in the mails.”
The contents of the mail-bags—that is, matter, lawfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
mailable—are commerce in the sense in which
that word is used in the Constitution.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">Constitutional provisions do not change, but their operation
extends to new matters as the modes of business
and the habits of life of the people vary with each succeeding
generation. The law of the common carrier is
the same to-day as when transportation on land was by
coach and wagon, and on water by canal boat and sailing
vessel, yet in its actual operation it touches and regulates
transportation by modes then unknown, the railroad
train and the steamship. Just so is it with the grant to
the national government of power over interstate commerce.
The Constitution has not changed. The power
is the same. But it operates to-day upon modes of interstate
commerce unknown to the fathers, and it will
operate with equal force upon any new modes of such
commerce which the future may develop.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Under the commerce clause Congress</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">may enact such legislation as shall declare void and prohibit
the performance of any contract between individuals
or corporations where the natural and direct effect
of such a contract will be, when carried out, to directly,
and not as a mere incident to other and innocent purposes
regulate to any substantial extent interstate commerce.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And “interstate” also includes “foreign commerce.”<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>All the decisions</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">illustrate the principle that Congress in the exercise of
its paramount power may prevent the common instrumentalities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
of interstate and intrastate commercial intercourse
from being used in their intrastate operations to
the injury of interstate commerce. This is not to say
that Congress possesses the authority to regulate the
internal commerce of a State, as such, but that it does
possess the power to foster and protect interstate commerce,
and to take all measures necessary or appropriate
to that end, although intrastate transactions of interstate
carriers may thereby be controlled.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF CONTRACTS AND PROPERTY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>70. The supreme law of the land provides that no
State shall pass any law impairing the obligation of
contracts.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> A contract is an agreement between
competent persons to do or not to do a certain thing;
the law is part of the contract.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> An unlawful contract
cannot be made, for the so-called contract,
being unlawful, has never existed as a contract.
The limitation as to contracts in the Constitution is
on the States. Thus a State can no more impair
its own contracts, by legislation, than it can impair
the obligation of the contracts of individuals.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> A
sovereign State is supposed to have a more scrupulous
regard to justice, and a higher morality than belongs
to the ordinary transactions of individuals.</p>

<p>71. A State may incorporate a bank which, by
its charter, is empowered to issue, and does issue,
stock, bills, or notes. These are contracts. By its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
police power the State may repeal that section of
the bank’s charter authorizing issues of notes, but
legislation affecting the stock, or notes, so as to
impair their obligation is unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> The
question is not one of currency but of impairing the
obligation of a contract. A legislature may make
a contract binding upon later legislatures,—as a law
existing at the time contracts under it are made, it
becomes part of them, but a municipal act levying a
tax upon city bonds held by non-residents diminishes
the value of the bonds and therefore impairs the
obligation of a contract.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> For the bonds call for a
certain interest payment at a certain time, and a tax
upon them, and retaining the same from payment,
make an entirely different contract from the original.
The constitutional provision against impairing contract
obligations is a limitation on the taxing power
as well as on all legislation—whatever its form.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p>72. But such limitation must not be confused
with legitimate exercise of the police powers of the
State. Thus an arrangement determinable at the
will of either party is not a contract beyond control,
change, or cessation under the police power. For
example, a bounty law, as for killing destructive
animals, or for the encouragement of manufactures
(the boring of salt wells and pumping of water from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
them for making salt), does not involve the State in a
contract. It is a matter purely voluntary on the
part of those who avail themselves of the opportunity,
and the Legislature may or may not continue the
law at discretion, as a matter of public policy.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>73. The execution of an office to which a person
has been lawfully elected, or appointed, by the performance,
by him, of its duties, is a completed contract,
with perfect obligation to pay for services
rendered at the rate of compensation fixed by the
contract, and this obligation can no more be impaired
by a law of the State than that arising on a
promissory note.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<p>74. The charters of private charitable institutions
are contracts within the letter of the Constitution,
and their obligation cannot be impaired without
violating it.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> But if a charter to a corporation, for
example a railroad, or a college, provides for possible
alteration or amendment by the Legislature of the
State, such power of alteration duly exercised by a
later Legislature is not unconstitutional as impairing
the obligation of a contract.<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>75. The police power of the State extends to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the protection of the lives, health, and property of
citizens, and to the preservation of good order and
the public morals, nor can the Legislature, by any
contract, divest itself of the power to provide for
these objects.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They belong emphatically to that class of objects
which demand the application of the maxim, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">salus
populi suprema lex</i>; and they are to be attained and
provided for by such appropriate means as the legislative
discretion may devise. That discretion can no more
be bargained away than the power itself.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In exercise of this police power the Legislature prohibits
the manufacture and sale of malt liquor.
Such manufacture or sale is not an exercise of a
right by contract, and prohibition of the business is
not legislation impairing the obligation of a contract.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
So too, a provision in a State constitution forbidding
lotteries and gift enterprises within a commonwealth,
and revoking lottery charters theretofore granted,
is not a law impairing the obligation of a contract.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>
The principle followed here is expressed by the
Chief Justice (Waite): “No legislature can bargain
away the public health or the public morals.” Thus
it may be accepted as settled constitutional law that
the people in their sovereign capacity and through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
their properly constituted agencies may exercise
powers as the public good may require.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> But
corporations and private persons possessing and
exercising rights and franchises vested in them by
law and possessing property rights by contract are
entitled to compensation when, under the State
power of eminent domain, such vested rights are
taken away.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>76. Whether property or employment possesses
the qualities or attributes of a public use will largely
determine the character of legislative control for the
purpose of safe-guarding the public against “danger,
injustice, and oppression”; the police power of the
State is here paramount.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<p>77. The principle involved in the obligation of
contracts is clearly set forth by the Supreme
Court:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In placing the obligation of contracts under the
protection of the Constitution, its framers looked to the
essentials of the contract more than to the forms and
modes of proceeding by which it was to be carried out
into execution; annulling State legislation which impaired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
the obligation, it was left to the States to prescribe
and shape the remedy to enforce it. The obligation of a
contract consists in its binding force on the party who
makes it. This depends on the laws in existence when
it is made; these are necessarily referred to in all contracts
and forming a part of them as the measure of the obligation
to perform them by the one party, and the right
acquired by the other. There can be no other standard
by which to ascertain the extent of either, than that
which the terms of the contract indicate according to
their settled legal meaning; when it becomes consummated,
the law defines the duty and the right, compels
one party to perform the thing contracted for, and gives
the other a right to enforce the performance by the
remedies then in force. If any subsequent law affect
to diminish the duty, or to impair the right, it necessarily
bears on the obligation of the contract, in favor of one
party, to the injury of the other; hence, any law which,
in its operation, amounts to a denial, or obstruction,
of the rights accruing by a contract, though professing
to act only on the remedy, is directly obnoxious to the
prohibition of the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
78. The prohibition of legislation impairing the
obligation of contracts does not extend to the United
States as it does to the States. Thus in the Legal
Tender Cases<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> and in sundry bankruptcy cases.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a>
the Supreme Court has decided that the exercise
of the power of Congress “does not depend upon
the incidental effect of its exercise on contracts, but
on the existence of the power itself.” This means
that the United States possesses a police power,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">salus populi suprema lex</i>, in exercise of which at the
discretion of Congress, the obligation of contracts
must yield to the higher obligation of the general
welfare.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>79. It is a fundamental of government in America
that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or
property without due process of law, nor shall private
property be taken for public use without compensation.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>
The prohibition and protection as to due
process of law extends both to the United States
and to the States. The taking by a State of the
private property of a person,—and a corporation is
legally a person,—without the owner’s consent, for
the private use of another is not due process of law,<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
and it violates the Fourteenth Amendment. A
State possesses exclusive jurisdiction and sovereignty
over persons and property within its territory and
consequently may determine for itself the civil
status and capacities of its inhabitants; may prescribe
the subjects upon which they may contract, and
regulate the manner and conditions upon which
property situated within its territory—or jurisdiction—may
be acquired, enjoyed, and transferred;
but no State can exercise direct jurisdiction and
authority over persons or property without its
jurisdiction. The laws of a State have no operation
outside its territory “except so far as is allowed by
comity; any exertion of authority by a State beyond
its territory is a nullity.” The sovereign power of
the State over property within its jurisdiction,
belonging to non-residents is exercisable as over the
property of residents. But the property right of the
non-resident cannot be invalidated save by due
process of law, which means, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">inter alia</i>, the right of
the non-resident to appear personally, or by representative,
in the courts of the State to protect his
own interests. A State law under which a nonresident’s
property should be taken without such
notice would be unconstitutional by the Fourteenth
Amendment.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
But the Fourteenth Amendment does not deprive
the States of their police power over “subjects within
their jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>80. The right of eminent domain is essentially
of the police power, and for State purposes is exclusively
within the State. Each State in the Union
regulates its domestic commerce, contracts, the
transmission of estates,—real and personal—and
acts upon all internal matters which relate to its
moral and political welfare. Over these subjects the
federal government has no power. The acknowledged
police power of a State extends often to the
destruction of property. A nuisance may be abated.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>
Thus a State constitution, or a statute under it,
prohibiting the manufacture and sale of intoxicating
liquors, except for medicinal, scientific, and mechanical
purposes, does not conflict with the clause of the
Fourteenth Amendment which provides that “no
State shall make or enforce any law which shall
abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States, nor shall any State deprive any person<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law.” The so-called “right” to manufacture or
sell such articles is not a right growing out of citizenship
of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Such manufacture or
sale, or its prohibition is wholly within the power
of the State to control.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>Such control is of wholly internal affairs. The
right to manufacture or sell such articles is not a
right under a contract as the word <em>contract</em> is used in
the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> Prohibition of the manufacture
and sale of such articles, save as excepted, does not
deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights. Such
prohibition is the policy of the supreme power in
the State and is an exercise of a function within its
jurisdiction.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The exercise of the police power of the State by the
destruction of property which is itself a public nuisance,
or the prohibition of its use in a particular way whereby
its value becomes depreciated, is very different from taking
property for public use, or from depriving a person
of his property without due process of law. In one
case, a nuisance only is abated; in the other, unoffending
property is taken away from an innocent owner.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p></blockquote>

<p>81. The provision of the Constitution that private
property shall not be taken for public use without
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>compensation is a limitation on the power of the
federal government, and not on the States,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> but
the State constitutions usually include the limitation
in their Bills of Rights: the principle is
“essentially a part of American constitutional
law.”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>82. For consequential injury resulting from the
exercise of the power of eminent domain there is no
redress,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> but where such exercise of power works
effectual destruction of land so as to impair its usefulness,
it is a taking of property for public use
and the owner is entitled to compensation.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> The
principle here is that,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If in such cases suitable and adequate provision
is made by the Legislature for the compensation of
those whose property or franchise is injured or taken
away, there is no violation of public faith or private
right.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is also a well-established principle that no construction
of the clause in the Bill of Rights (in any
constitution) providing compensation for property
taken for a public use shall so extend the benefits
of the clause as to give indirect or consequential<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
damages to a person when the public already has a
rightful use of the property.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p>83. Though the right of eminent domain and
its exercise are not enumerated in the Constitution,
the power being inseparable from sovereignty and the
right being the offspring of political necessity, must
be recognized as existing. The right is one of these
which is not denied, and being essential, is implied.
Were the right to acquire property, and for other
purposes, denied the United States, the unwillingness
of property-holders to sell, or legislation by a State
prohibiting a sale to the federal government would
make nugatory the government itself, and its existence
would thus depend upon the will of a State,
or even upon that of a private citizen.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> The essential
matter here is of sovereignty, or jurisdiction. The
two sovereignties, the several States and the United
States, possess, each, this right commensurable
with their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The proper view of the right of eminent domain seems
to be, that it is a right belonging to a sovereignty to take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
private property for its own public uses, and not alone
for those of another. Beyond that, there exists no necessity;
which alone is the foundation of the right. If the
United States have the power, it must be complete in
itself. It can neither be enlarged nor diminished by a
State.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p></blockquote>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII" class="vspace">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF THE EXECUTIVE POWER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>84. The executive power of the United States
is vested in a President. The executive is single,—that
is, one person. He possesses all the executive
powers which the sovereign,—the people of the
United States, have conferred. His power is derivative,
not original. His power is not defined by the
Constitution, that is, it is not fully set forth by
limitations. It is limited in two particulars: he
cannot grant reprieves or pardons in cases of impeachment,
and he solemnly swears or affirms
faithfully to execute the office of President of the
United States. This solemn obligation implies that
he himself is not the sole or the final judge of his
fidelity in executing his office. This responsibility
of the President to a superior, in certain cases, is
clearly stated by the Constitution itself: first, that
the House of Representatives shall have the sole
power of impeachment, and secondly, that the
Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments,
and when sitting for that purpose, its members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
shall be on oath or affirmation. When the President
is tried, the Chief Justice of the United States shall
preside, and no person shall be convicted without the
concurrence of two thirds of the members present.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<p>85. Whether or not the President has performed
the duties of his office is a political question and
may alone be determined by impeachment and
conviction. President Johnson was impeached but
not convicted,—whence the conclusion that he
faithfully executed the office of President. The
term “office” is not used in the Constitution as
descriptive of the exercise of legislative power by
either House or by its respective members. Senators
and Representatives receive a compensation for their
“services.” No person holding any “office” under
the United States can be a member of either House
during his continuance in “office.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> But the Constitution
does not apply the term “office” to the two-year
term of a Representative, or to the six-year
term of a Senator, or to the duties, rights, privileges,
qualifications, or powers of either. We shall see that
the term is applied to judges of the United States.</p>

<p>86. The executive power of the United States
is vested in a President, and the faithful exercise of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
that delegated power is the faithful execution of the
office of President. From the nature of the power
it cannot be defined. The office was created by the
people of the United States at the close of the eighteenth
century, when distrust of the executive (the
crown) was dominant in the American mind. The
trend then was to enthrone the legislative and to
dethrone the executive. It is remarkable that the
supreme law of the land, made at that time, should
vest such vast powers in the executive. He is
commander-in-chief of the army and navy and of
the State militia when in the actual service of the
United States<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> but Congress alone can declare war.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>
He participates in legislation, and possesses the
veto power (which constitutionally comprises that
participation)<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> but unlike the governor, under some
later constitutions, he cannot veto a particular item
in an appropriation bill.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<p>He makes treaties, provided two thirds of the
Senators present concur,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> and the control of our
foreign relations is in his hands.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Thus, though not
possessing the war power by the verbal provisions of
the Constitution, he may by his policy, involve
the United States in war. He possesses the appointing
power, thus determining who shall fill judicial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
and administrative offices, under the Constitution,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
a power, the exercise of which practically determines
the character of the federal government. In brief,
excepting members of the Senate and of the House,
all now elected directly by the people and who, at
present, comprise, numerically, about one one thousandth
part of the aggregate public servants in the
government of the United States, the President,—that
is, the executive power of the United States
delegated to the President, appoints the vast body
of officials in the national service. Most of these
officials have ministerial duties; a few have judicial.
Strictly speaking, the President is the only executive
officer provided for by the Constitution.</p>

<p>87. In the “Executive Department” (an expression
known to the Constitution<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>), it is the President
alone who makes the appointments. “The principal
officer in each of the executive departments” is
known to us as a member of the Cabinet, and is an
appointee of the President. The office of a member
of the Cabinet affords an illustration of that rare
tenure, a tenant at will. This tenure is stated by
Lincoln in a memorandum read to his Cabinet:
“I must myself be the judge how long to retain and
when to remove any of you from his position.”<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>88. The President cannot be enjoined from dismissing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
or be mandamused to receive a person,
from or into his Cabinet. Indeed, such is the
nature of the office of President, he is not amenable
to writs of the law. He cannot be compelled by law
to approve or to disapprove a bill that has
passed Congress; or to appoint or to refrain from
appointing any person to any office within his
jurisdiction. Nor can he be questioned in any
court of law respecting his office, nor be made a witness
in any controversy. His powers are adequate
to the execution of his office. It may be said that
this is essentially true of the legislative,—the Congress,
and of the judiciary,—the Courts of the
United States.</p>

<p>89. Thus the President has power to protect a
federal judge from threatened personal attack.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>
He has power to receive ambassadors and other
public ministers and representatives of other sovereignties,
a power which implies his right to refuse to
receive those sent, or to dismiss those sent, or to
request their recall, or to discontinue relations with
them. Nor can any person, or State, through any
court of law, compel or forbid him to do either. In
other words, the powers of the President of the
United States are executive, not ministerial. This
distinction applies to no appointee of the President,
in any of the executive departments. Their office<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
is ministerial and every ministerial office in the
government of the United States is subject to inquiry
through a court of law.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>Thus the executive power of the United States is
not subject to the legislative power.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> We have seen
that it is not subject to the judicial power. Yet, if
this be so, by what power can the President be
impeached for not faithfully executing his office?</p>

<p>90. The restraint of impeachment is not legislation
nor the exercise of legislative powers vested in
Congress. Impeachment is the accusation made by
the House of Representatives that the President
has not faithfully executed his office. Conviction is
the adverse judgment of the Court of Impeachment,—the
Senate sitting under special oath for a special
purpose, not legislative, as duly provided for by the
Constitution. Had the people of the United States,
in 1787, chosen to provide, in the Constitution, for a
Court of Impeachment consisting, say, of Governors
of States, or that State Legislatures should have
the sole power of impeachment, no one would claim
that the governors or the legislators so engaged
were exercising either executive or legislative functions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
So the Houses of Congress engaged in an
impeachment trial of the President, or of any “officer
of the United States” are not engaged in legislation.
If Congress possessed legislative power to remove
the President, it could vacate the presidential office
by an act and pass it over the President’s veto.
Such a power vested in Congress would nullify the
power vested in the President and would make him a
creature of Congress.</p>

<p>91. The constitutional provision that when the
Senate sits as a Court of Impeachment the Chief
Justice of the United States shall preside,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> in no
way affects the judicial power vested in the supreme
and inferior Courts of the United States. The
reason for the provision is obvious. The Senate,
which is the special Court of Impeachment, has
ordinarily, and by the Constitution, two presiding
officers: one, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex officio</i>, the Vice-President; the other,
the President <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tempore</i>, who is a Senator.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<p>The conviction of a President removes him from
the office and the Vice-President (or whosoever by
law is in line of succession) succeeds him. The President
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tempore</i> of the Senate, votes in the Court of
Impeachment as a Senator. If either the Vice-President,
or the President <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">pro tempore</i> presided over
the Court of Impeachment, when a President is on
trial, the principle of freedom from official, or one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
may say, personal bias would be violated. The
Chief Justice presides,—an official of high rank,
disinterested, save to be fair to all parties, and
capable of so ruling. But when the Court of Impeachment
sits to try other officials (except the Vice-President)
the Chief Justice does not preside. When
he presides and makes rulings they are not comparable
to rulings or decisions he renders as the voice
of the Supreme Court. The finding of the Court
of Impeachment is not analogous to the decisions
of that Court.</p>

<p>92. It follows therefore that the executive power
of the United States, vested in the President, is not
subject to the legislative or to the judicial power. It
is independent of either or both. Yet the people of
the United States have provided for their relief from
a faithless execution of the office of President by
combining Congress and the Chief Justice of the
United States as a special body, or agency, a Court
of Impeachment through which to secure relief.</p>

<p>93. It is evident that the power of the President
of the United States is very great.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The scope of this executive power has never been
realized [remarked President Hayes], and the practical
use of power, even by an ordinarily strong President, is
greater than the books ever described. The executive
power is large because not defined in the Constitution.
The real test has never come, because the Presidents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
down to the present, have been conservative, or what
might be called conscientious, men, and have kept within
limited range. And there is an unwritten law of usage
that has come to regulate an average administration.
But if a Napoleon ever became President, he would
make the executive almost what he wished to make it.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>
Practically the President has the nation in his hands.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p></blockquote>

<p>94. The principle, difficult to understand, regulative
of the constitutional law of the executive power,
is the principle of executive as distinct from ministerial
power.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A ministerial duty, the performance of which may, in
proper cases, be required of the head of a department,
by judicial process, is one in which respect to nothing is
left to discretion. It is a simple, definite duty, arising
under conditions admitted or proved to exist, and imposed
by law.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This means that where the law requires the performance
of a single specific act, there is no room for the
exercise of judgment, there is nothing left to discretion;
the act is ministerial. “Very different is the
duty of the President in the exercise of the power to
see that the laws are faithfully executed,—the duty
thus imposed is in no sense ministerial; it is purely
executive and political.”<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
In application of this principle</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Congress is the legislative department of the
government; the President is the executive department.
Neither can be restrained in its action by the judicial
department; though the acts of both, when performed,
are, in proper cases, subject to cognizance.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p></blockquote>

<p>95. The principle applies alike to the States.
The control of the exercise of powers belonging exclusively
to the executive department of the government
of a State can in no sense or degree be assumed
by either of the other departments, as such control
would amount to the performance of executive
duties by the legislative or the judiciary, a confusion
of functions distinctly forbidden by the constitution.
And it has been decided that “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mandamus</i> will not
issue to the Governor to compel the performance of
<em>any</em> duty pertaining to his office, whether political
or merely ministerial; whether commanded by the
constitution or by some law passed on the subject.”<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
The principle of American constitutional law as to
executive and ministerial powers is thus stated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Court will not interfere by <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mandamus</i> with the
executive officers of the government in the exercise
of their ordinary official duties, even where those duties
require an interpretation of the law, the Court having no
appellate power for that purpose; but when they refuse
to act in a case at all, or when by special statute, or
otherwise, a more ministerial duty is imposed upon them,
that is, a service which they are bound to perform without
further question, then, if they refuse, a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">mandamus</i> may
be issued to compel them.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF JUDICIAL POWER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>96. The people of the United States, like other
sovereignties, possess not only legislative and executive
functions, but also judicial. The possession of
these three powers by sovereignty is essential to
its existence and a condition of any conception of it.
The judicial power of the United States is vested in
one Supreme Court and in such inferior courts as
Congress from time to time may ordain and establish.
This is a delegation of judicial power.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> The
inferior courts are established by Congress but the
power of these courts is delegated to them by the
people of the United States through the Constitution.
Thus it may be said that these inferior courts
exist by act of Congress but their authority is delegated
to them by the same sovereignty that empowers
Congress to create them. The power of the
Supreme Court is defined in the word <em>supreme</em>, and
that of the inferior courts in the word <em>inferior</em>.
Congress can neither increase nor decrease this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
power; the sovereign alone, the people of the United
States can modify the grant. This it has done by
the Eleventh Amendment, ratified in 1798:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The judicial power of the United States shall not be
construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced
or prosecuted against one of the United States by
citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of
any foreign State.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This Amendment was added in compliance with
the idea,—at the time dominant in America,—that
a State, a member of the Union, is a sovereign, and
being sovereign, cannot be made defendant (that is,
cannot be sued) at the suit of a citizen or subject of
another State, or of a foreign country. The idea
was,—and is,—that an American Commonwealth
may be petitioned, like any other sovereign, but can
be sued only in its own courts and with its own
consent.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> In conformity to this idea the Constitution
was so amended as to deny to the courts of the
United States any jurisdiction whatever in any
case in which an American Commonwealth is made
a defendant.</p>

<p>97. This Amendment is a limitation of the
judicial power delegated to the government of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
United States and save in some particulars of applied
judicial jurisdiction as original or appellate, is the
only limitation. On the principle that the government
of the United States “must possess all the
means and have a right to resort to all the methods
of executing the powers with which it is intrusted
that are possessed and exercised by the governments
of the particular States,”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> the judicial power vested
in the federal courts must be sufficient for all the
functions and purposes of the federal government.
The judicial power of the United States extends to
all cases, in law and equity, arising under the Constitution,
the laws of the United States, and the
treaties made under its authority; to all cases affecting
ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;
to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to
controversies to which the United States is a party;
to controversies between two or more States; between
citizens of different States; between citizens of the
same State claiming lands under grants from different
States, and between a State, or its citizens, and
foreign states, citizens, or subjects, save and except as
jurisdiction is limited by the Eleventh Amendment.<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<p>98. It will be observed that the judicial power
thus delegated to the United States includes jurisdiction
over cases arising outside the domain strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
included (as popularly understood) within the government
of the United States. That government
is, of necessity and by its nature, a distinct government,
possessing powers and functions and purposes
of its own, delegated and set forth in the Constitution.
Fundamentally there is a government of the
United States distinct from the government of the
States. The judicial power of the United States
includes jurisdiction over controversies to which
States are a party,—that is, to controversies to
which the United States is not a party. The jurisdiction
here has no reference to the controversy but to
the status of the parties to the controversy.</p>

<p>99. <cite>The Federalist</cite> sets forth the principle here
involved:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there are such things as political axioms, the propriety
of the judicial power of a government being co-extensive
with its legislative, may be ranked among the
number. The mere necessity of uniformity in the interpretation
of the national laws decides the question.
Thirteen (1787; forty-eight, 1917) independent courts of
final jurisdiction over the same causes, is a hydra in
government, from which nothing but contradiction and
confusion can proceed.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This aspect of the judicial power of the United
States concerns the interpretation of the supreme
law. One purpose of that law is “to insure domestic
tranquillity,”—that is, the peace of the Union.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
The Constitution imposes restrictions on the States,
which of course means restrictions on their legislatures,
their governors, and their courts. Upon principles
of good government the States are prohibited
from doing many things. How shall infractions of
the supreme law be determined? Either by a congressional
negative, or by the authority of the
federal courts overruling whatsoever act of the
State contravenes the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a></p>

<p>100. But the judicial power of the United States
extends yet further,—to controversies “in which the
State tribunals cannot be supposed to be impartial
and unbiased.”<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> The principle here is that the
whole is greater than a part;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">that the peace of the whole ought not to be left at the
disposal of a part. “No man ought to be a judge in his
own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has the
least interest or bias.”<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> On the principle that every
government ought to possess the means of executing its
own provisions by its own authority,</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">it follows that it is necessary that the construction
of the Constitution,—the supreme <span class="locked">law,—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">should be committed to that tribunal which, having no
local attachments, will be likely to be impartial between
different States and their citizens, and which, owing its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
official existence to the Union, will never be likely to
feel any bias inauspicious to the principles on which it is
founded.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p></blockquote>

<p>101. The exercise of judicial power by the Supreme
Court is provided for, in part, by the Constitution,
but Congress is authorized to ordain and establish
inferior courts,—which means to define their respective
jurisdictions; to bestow upon a court so much
judicial power, and to make such restrictions, rules,
and regulations as Congress itself may deem proper.
Thus Congress establishes such courts and defines
their several jurisdictions, but whatsoever judicial
power a court possesses, by act of Congress, the court
derives from the Constitution in its grant of such
power. The jurisdiction of any inferior court of the
United States, thus defined by Congress, may vary,
from time to time, by act of Congress, but every case
arising in the court must be shown, by the record
of the court, to be within its jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> The
reason for this important rule (and seeming restriction)
conforms to the essential principle in all judicial
proceeding: the principle of authority. No court
acts without authority and, as judicial examination
has for its ultimate purpose the settlement of controversy
in a legal manner, the jurisdiction of the court
is of primary importance. One of the purposes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
the Union is “to establish justice,” and precision
in the whole matter of exercise of judicial power is
essential.</p>

<p>102. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
the United States is both original and appellate.
Its original jurisdiction is defined in the Constitution
as “in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public
ministers and consuls, and those in which a State is
a party.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> The Court can have original jurisdiction
in no other cases, nor can Congress extend or diminish
the Court’s jurisdiction. Thus to the words
in the Constitution conferring original jurisdiction
on the Court “a negative or exclusive sense must
be given, or they have no operation at all.”<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> The
original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court was conferred
because of the dignity and rank of the Court,
and the rank of the parties thus privileged to appear
before it at first instance. Ambassadors, public
ministers, and consuls represent sovereignties, and a
State in the Union is “for some purposes sovereign,
for some purposes subordinate.”<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> On this delegation
of original jurisdiction Chief Justice Marshall
remarks: “There is, perhaps, no part of the article
under consideration so much required by national
policy as this.”<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The rank of the parties is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
reason for giving them the right to begin their case
in the Supreme Court. They are not excluded from
beginning it in some other court. But Congress, in
establishing an inferior court, may deny to it any
jurisdiction in cases to which foreign representatives
are a party.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> The right of ambassadors, public
ministers, and consuls to begin their suits in the
Supreme Court is a privilege accorded them because
of their governments, and not because of themselves.
As they are accredited to the Government of the
United States and not to any State government, it is
proper that the United States courts, and of these
the Supreme Court, should have original jurisdiction
in their cases.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> In all the other cases mentioned in
the Constitution the Supreme Court has appellate
jurisdiction; that is, cases come before the Court on
appeal from the decision of some inferior federal
court, or from some State court, as provided by law.
The entire procedure in an appeal to the Supreme
Court is regulated by Congress. If a party, whether
private person, private corporation, or public corporation,
citizen, or State is within the jurisdiction of
the United States, then that person or corporation,
if a party to a case or controversy at law, is within
the jurisdiction of a federal court. The Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
is the supreme law of the land and this Constitution,
the acts of Congress and the treaties made by its
authority are the law of federal jurisdiction. Thus
it is commonly and truly said, that whensoever the
Constitution, or a treaty, or an act of Congress is
involved in the controversy, the federal courts
(as their several jurisdictions are determined by
law) have jurisdiction in the case. The principle is
one of sovereignty.</p>

<p>103. The State for some purposes retains its
sovereignty,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> as in the exercise of its police power.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
By the Constitution, the judicial power of the United
States extends “to all cases of admiralty and maritime
jurisdiction,” but the State has jurisdiction to
punish crimes committed within its territory; to
regulate fisheries within that territory, and to punish
those who violate its regulations. The admiralty and
maritime jurisdiction of the United States extends
to the high seas, to the navigable waters of the
United States, to the Great Lakes, and to rivers and
lakes wholly within a State. Over its own territory
the State has jurisdiction; thus the territory which is
the scene, or area, or location of the act may be
subject to both State and federal jurisdiction, and
is always within one or the other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
104. In creating inferior courts, Congress determines
the jurisdiction but not the judicial power
exercisable within the jurisdiction. Congress does
not control the judges in their execution of their
office. Judicial power, of whatever extent, is conferred
by the Constitution; it is power of a judicial
nature delegated by the people of the United States.
The inferior courts of the United States sit in the
several States, but the right to determine the jurisdiction
of these courts is placed not in the State
Legislatures (though these Legislatures have by
delegated authority, jurisdiction of this territory),
but in the supreme judicial tribunal of the nation,—that
is, in the Supreme Court of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
This means that the Supreme Court “says what the
law is.” This is the peculiar office of courts of law.
This is another way of saying that the sovereign,
the people of the United States, has delegated to the
Supreme Court and to inferior courts of the United
States not legislative or executive but judicial
powers. The courts of law exercise judicial powers
as the President exercises executive and the Congress
exercises legislative powers,—in order to accomplish
the purposes set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.
The courts are empowered to accomplish
this purpose only in a judicial way.</p>

<p>105. The inferior courts, established by Congress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
have such jurisdiction as Congress in its wisdom sees
fit to give them save that the jurisdiction belonging
to the Supreme Court cannot be given to an inferior
court; there can be but one Supreme Court. The
relation of the State courts to the courts of the United
States is partly determined by the Constitution,
partly by act of Congress. The circumstances under
which a case in or from a State court may be transferred,
or appealed, to a federal court are various,
but the essential reason for such transfer is that the
jurisdiction of the United States as defined by the
Constitution, a treaty, or an act of Congress, is
involved. A case or controversy not involving that
jurisdiction cannot arise in any federal court. The
possible relations of the Constitution, treaties, and
acts of Congress to individuals (persons natural),
to corporations (persons artificial, as private corporations),
and to States (public corporations), are
beyond calculation. The line of demarcation between
the jurisdiction of State courts and that of
federal courts cannot be fixed by any brief definition
or survey. In some instances the jurisdiction
is a matter of choice by parties, the court that first
takes jurisdiction having it, as it were, by first instance,
but in such cases there exists by law a concurrent
jurisdiction, judicial procedure being open to
parties in either the State or the federal court. In
practice, a court restricts itself to its own jurisdiction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
106. It has been said that one test of demarcation
between the two jurisdictions is the common law;
that each State has the common law but the United
States has statute law only. This difference (if
true) would restrict federal courts to an exercise
of judicial power delegated by the Constitution and
set forth in laws made by its authority, while the
State courts would administer justice in accord
with the law of the States which are both common
law and statutory. It must be remembered, however,
that federal courts sit in the several States
and administer whatsoever law is the local (State)
law, taking judicial notice of State statutes, of
decisions of State courts, of usages, of the common
law as existing in the State, and, therefore, exercising
a jurisdiction essentially the same as the State
courts. Emphasis may well be placed on the custom
of federal courts to follow closely the decisions of
State courts,—the result being that State decisions
become final in federal courts as do federal decisions
in State courts. But the States cannot increase
or diminish the jurisdiction of federal courts, nor
can Congress increase or diminish the jurisdiction
of State courts. Although both courts may have
jurisdiction in certain cases, collisions of authority
are prevented by good sense and comity among
State and federal judges.</p>

<p>107. The essential power of any federal court is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
to exercise federal judicial jurisdiction. This means,
practically, that a federal court does not and cannot
exercise State powers. The converse also is true:
no State court can exercise federal powers, unless
granted those powers by the Constitution, a treaty,
or an act of Congress; but a State court exercising
any federal powers, is thereby a federal court.
The Constitution provides that the judges in every
State shall be bound by the supreme law of the land,
anything in the constitution or laws of any State to
the contrary notwithstanding. This solemn oath of
State judges to support the Constitution as the
supreme law gives them jurisdiction “to say what
the law is,”<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> and howsoever rarely they may exercise
the power vested in them to do so, State judges may
take judicial notice of any law, State or federal, as
harmonizing or conflicting with the Constitution;
this means that a State court may pronounce an
act of Congress unconstitutional, but the decision
of that court is not final: there is but one Supreme
Court of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>108. Territorial courts are to be distinguished
from courts of the United States. They are not
federal courts as are the Supreme Court and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
inferior courts, namely, the Circuit Courts, the
District Courts, or the Court of Claims. Neither
are they State courts.</p>

<p>The Constitution being made only for the people
of the United States,—that is, for the people of the
United States inhabiting States,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> does not apply or
extend to the territories unless extended by act of
Congress. The courts in a territory are created by
Congress and have such powers (or jurisdiction) as
the act creating them provides. But in creating
them, Congress is limited by the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>
Congress also creates courts martial, but the jurisdiction
of these courts is always subject to inquiry by
civil courts. Fundamentally, the reason here is the
supremacy of the civil over the military authority
in the American system of government.</p>

<p>109. A problem not infrequently arising in courts
of law is the solution of some political question
involved. All political questions are questions for
the political department of the government to
settle; they lie wholly outside of the jurisdiction of
the courts. Thus the courts never decide as to the
wisdom or folly of an executive or legislative act,—and
in one form or another, every act of Congress
or President is politically wise or unwise according
to the political belief of the critic. Nor do the
debates over an act fix the meaning of the act, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
the court. Where the court was asked to refer to the
debates in Congress to determine the meaning of the
act, it was said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All that can be determined from the debates and
reports is that various members had various views, and
we are left to determine the meaning of this act, as we
determine the meaning of other acts, from the language
used therein. There is, too, a general acquiescence in
the doctrine that debates in Congress are not appropriate
sources of information from which to discover the
meaning of the language of a statute passed by that
body.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>The reason, [continues the court], is that it is impossible
to determine with certainty what construction was put
upon an act by the members of a legislative body that
passed it by resorting to the speeches of individual
members thereof. Those who did not speak may not
have agreed with those who did, and those who spoke
might differ from each other, the result being that the
only proper way to construe a legislative act is from the
language used in the act, and, upon occasion, by a

<p>110. In 1828 the Supreme Court sustained as a
constitutional exercise of the war power the right
of the United States to acquire territory by conquest
or treaty.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> The issue in the case was “the relation
in which Florida (at the time a Territory) stands to
the United States.” It was an issue in law, not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
politics. Whether A or B is the lawful governor of a
State is an issue, when legally drawn, for the State
courts; but whether a community calling itself a
State, is a member of the Union, or should be admitted
into it, under the Fourth Article of the Constitution
is a political question and is for Congress to
decide.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It rests with Congress to decide what government is
the established one in a State. For as the United States
guarantees to each State a republican form of government,
Congress must necessarily decide what government is
established in the State before it can determine whether
it is republican or not. And when the senators and
representatives of a State are admitted into the councils
of the Union, the authority of the government under
which they are appointed, as well as its republican
character, is recognized by the proper constitutional
authority. And its decision is binding on every other
department of the government, and could not be questioned
in a judicial tribunal.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The right to decide such a political question is in
Congress and not in the courts.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>111. The final authority of American courts of
law to construe statutes and constitutions is distinctive.
The court pronounces a law unconstitutional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
and thus expounds the constitution. “This
results,” says Cooley, “from the nature of its
jurisdiction.” Chief Justice Marshall, in 1803, first
applied this principle in a Federal court:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Government of the United States has been emphatically
termed a government of laws and not of men.</p>

<p>The Constitution is the supreme law of the land.</p>

<p><em>It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is.</em><a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In these words is stated the essential doctrine of
judicial supremacy. As the doctrine is fundamental,
the reason for it is essential to a proper understanding
of its vast import:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the people have an original right to establish
for their future government such principles as in their
opinion shall most conduce to their own happiness, is
the basis on which the whole American fabric has been
erected. The exercise of this original right is a very
great exertion; nor can it, nor ought it to be frequently
repeated. The principles, therefore, so established are
deemed fundamental. And as the authority from which
they proceed is supreme, and can seldom act, they are
designed to be permanent. This original and supreme
will organizes the government, and assigns to different
departments their respective powers. It may either stop
here or establish certain limits not to be transcended by
those departments.... It is a proposition too plain
to be contested, that the Constitution controls any legislative
act repugnant to it; or that the Legislature may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
alter the Constitution by an ordinary act. Between
these alternatives there is no middle ground. The Constitution
is either a superior, paramount law, unchangeable
by ordinary means, or it is on a level with ordinary
legislative acts and, like other acts, is alterable when the
legislature shall please to alter it. If the former part of
the alternative be true, then a legislative act contrary
to the Constitution is not law; if the latter part be true,
then written constitutions are absurd attempts on the
part of the people to limit a power in its own nature
illimitable. Certainly all those who have framed written
constitutions contemplate them as forming a fundamental
and paramount law of the nation, and consequently
the theory of every such government must be, that an
act of the Legislature repugnant to the constitution is
void.... It is emphatically the province and duty
of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those
who apply the rule to particular cases must of necessity
expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict
with each other, the courts must decide on the operation
of each. So, if a law be in opposition to the Constitution,
if both the law and the Constitution apply to a particular
case, so that the court must either decide the case conformably
to the law disregarding the Constitution, or
conformably to the Constitution disregarding the law,
the court must determine which of these conflicting
rules governs the case. This is of the very essence of
judicial duty.... Those, then, who controvert the
principle that the Constitution is to be considered in
court as a paramount law, are reduced to the necessity
of maintaining that courts must close their eyes on the
Constitution, and see only the law. This doctrine would
subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions.
It would declare that an act, which according to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
principles and theory of our government is entirely void,
is yet in practice completely obligatory.... It would
be giving the Legislature a practical and real omnipotence
with the same breath which professes to restrict
their powers within narrow limits. That it thus reduces
to nothing what we have deemed the greatest improvement
on political institutions,—a written constitution,—would
of itself be sufficient, in America, where written
constitutions have been viewed with so much reverence,
for rejecting the construction. But the peculiar expressions
of the Constitution of the United States furnish
additional arguments in favor of its rejection.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The conclusion of the whole matter is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus the particular phraseology of the Constitution of
the United States confirms and strengthens the principle,
supposed to be essential to all written constitutions, that
a law repugnant to the constitution is void; and that
courts, as well as other departments, are bound by that
instrument.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p></blockquote>

<p>112. The federal (or the State) judiciary, while
final judge of what the law is, is not the judge of what
the law should be: such action would be a violation
of judicial functions and an assumption of legislative
functions.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> The court in saying what the law is,
that is, what it means, does not attempt to say what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the law should be, that is, to make the law. Therefore
it is perilous, as likely to embarrass the court,
for the court to be subject to the call of the executive,
or the legislative, to give an opinion “upon important
questions of law, and upon solemn occasions.”<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> The
peril lies in possible confusion of governmental
functions, or, to use the constitutional term, “offices.”
The American people have delegated judicial power
to the courts: the people of the several States to their
State courts; the people of the United States, to the
federal courts; and “it is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the
law is.”</p>

<p>113. This province the American judiciary occupies,
this duty it performs, with the result that it
holds a unique place in political history. At no
other time, among no other people, in no other
form of government has the judiciary executed
the office it executes in the American system of
government.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the consciousness of the American people that
law must rest upon justice and reason, that the constitution
is a more ultimate formulation of the fundamental
principles of justice and reason than mere legislative acts,
and that the judiciary is a better interpreter of these
fundamental principles than the Legislature,—it is this
consciousness which has given such authority to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme
Court.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Yet,—so remarks the Supreme Court <span class="locked">itself,—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The slightest consideration of the nature, the character,
the organization, and the powers of (federal) courts will
dispel any fear of serious injury to the government at
their hands. While by the Constitution the judicial
department is recognized as one of the three great
branches among which all the powers and functions of
the government are distributed, it is inherently the
weakest of them all. Dependent as its courts are for the
enforcement of their judgments upon officers appointed
by the executive and removable at pleasure, with no
patronage and no control of the purse or the sword, their
power and influence rest solely upon the public sense of
the necessity for the existence of a tribunal to which all
may appeal for the assertion and protection of rights
guaranteed by the Constitution and by the laws of the
land, and on the confidence reposed in the soundness of
their decisions and the purity of their motives.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p></blockquote>

<p>114. To the question, “What is constitutional
law in the United States?” the answer is, “Law as
interpreted by the Supreme Court.” In other
countries, and, generally speaking, in all countries
at all times, until the institution of the political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
system of the United States,—the American system
of government,—the supreme law of the land was the
will of the executive (as in absolute monarchies), or
the supreme will of the legislative (as in Great
Britain). So long as the Supreme Court of the
United States retains the confidence of the American
people, the decisions of that Court will remain the
authoritative exposition of American constitutional
law.</p>

<p>It follows that the normal execution of the judicial
office in America determines the meaning of American
constitutional law; or stated in other words, in
the decisions of the Supreme Court there are found
the formulation of the principles on which law in
America is founded, and the application of these
principles in testing, as issues arise, the acts of the
legislative and the services of the administrative.
Therefore it is to the interpretation thus given by
the judiciary that we turn for an understanding
of the exercise of offices,—legislative, executive, or
judicial, delegated as powers by the sovereign, the
people of the United States. Whatsoever is done,
by either (so-called) department of government in
conformity with this delegation of powers is constitutional;
and whatsoever is done by either department
in conflict with this delegation of powers
is unconstitutional. Whether constitutional or unconstitutional
it is the exalted and unique office of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the Supreme Court to determine. This Court
therefore touches American life at every point.
Exhaustive examination of its interpretation principles,
laws, judicial decisions, arguments of counsel,
opinions of experts, writings of jurists, and the
history of society,—and such examination alone,
answers the question, “What is constitutional law
in America?”</p>

<p>In attempting, then, to summarize, the essentials
of American constitutional law, it is from the decisions
of the Supreme Court, as from no other
source, one must derive any authoritative interpretation.</p>

<p>115. The three departments of government are
distinct.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The legislative shall never exercise the executive and
judicial powers, or either of them; the executive shall
never exercise the legislative or judicial powers, or either
of them; the judicial shall never exercise the executive or
legislative powers, or either of them; to the end it may
be a government of laws and not of men.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This principle of separation of powers, or offices, of
government, is, for many purposes, not merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
fundamental, but primary, in American constitutional
law. A department of government can execute
only the offices, or powers, delegated to it,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> but the
Legislature cannot impose other than judicial duties
upon courts of law, or judicial duties upon other
than the judiciary.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<p>It follows from this principle that acts done by the
legislative, or the judiciary, or the executive, in due
course,—that is, according to rules of procedure and
in the mode required by law, are official acts and
are to be accredited as such.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> Thus laws which
appear on the face of them to be attested by the
proper officials of the two Houses, duly signed by the
Executive (or, passed over his vote as provided by
the Constitution), and published by the official
authorized to publish them are legislative acts,
(laws) in a constitutional sense. So the records of
courts of law made and kept in due procedure, and
officially authenticated, are judicial records in a
constitutional sense.</p>

<p>116. The original jurisdiction of the Supreme
Court is co-extensive with the judicial power delegated
by the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> Congress has power
to give the inferior courts of the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
“original jurisdiction in any case to which the
appellate jurisdiction extends.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p>In all cases in which the Constitution, or a treaty,
or an act of Congress is involved, the United States
through some one of its courts has jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>The exemption of an ambassador, public minister,
or consul from suits in particular courts “is the
privilege, not of the person who happens to fill the
office, but of the State or government he represents.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>
Consuls are oftentimes citizens, not aliens; any
exemptions or privileges claimed by such a person
accrue to him as consul being an alien, not as consul
being also a citizen, of the United States.</p>

<p>The admiralty jurisdiction of the United States
extends over all water on which commerce is carried
on between different States, or nations.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> The
principle of national commercial jurisdiction is
essentially that of national political jurisdiction, a
jurisdiction thus declared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We hold it to be an incontrovertible principle that
the Government of the United States may, by means of
physical force, exercised through its official agents,
execute on every foot of American soil the powers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
functions that belong to it. This necessarily involves the
power to command obedience to its laws....<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is a fundamental of our constitutional law that
no suit can be maintained against the United States,
in any court, without express authority of Congress;
and the United States cannot be sued in the courts
of any State in any case.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> It is the sovereign right
of the United States not to be sued. To the extent
that a State is sovereign it has the same right, and
“These States are constituent parts of the United
States. They are members of one great empire—for
some purposes sovereign, for some purposes
subordinate.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The physical boundaries of a State,
constituting a political, not a judicial question, must
be determined by legislative authority, yet if the
United States is a party to a case involving the issue
of territorial boundary, the case falls within the
judicial power,—that is, within the jurisdiction of
the courts of the Union.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The States of the Union have agreed in the Constitution
that the judicial power of the United States shall
extend to <em>all</em> cases arising under the Constitution, laws,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
and treaties of the United States, without regard to the
character of the parties (excluding of course, suits against
a State by its own citizens, or by citizens or subjects of
foreign states), and equally to controversies to which the
United States shall be a party, without regard to the
subject of such controversies, and that (the Supreme
Court) may exercise original jurisdiction in all such
cases [in which a State shall be a party] without excluding
those in which the United States may be the opposite
party.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In other words, the United States possesses
adequate governmental authority and jurisdiction
to secure the large purposes outlined in the
Preamble to the Constitution. The United States
has judicial jurisdiction in all cases arising under the
Constitution, the laws and the treaties of the United
States “whoever may be the parties.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> This
principle is of far-reaching effect; no party can be
exempt.</p>

<p>117. A corporation created by a State is a citizen
of that State for many purposes, but cannot be a
citizen of another State because created by the
former State. Outside of the State of its creation it
is a foreign corporation and possesses only such
privileges as are granted to it. This means that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
rights, privileges, judgments accruing to or possessed
by a corporation, say created by Pennsylvania
and in Pennsylvania, do not accrue to and are not
possessed by that corporation, say in Ohio, unless
conferred by Ohio and possessed by the corporation
within Ohio, under laws of Ohio, and by decision of
Ohio courts. The principle here is the familiar one
of jurisdiction. No State has power beyond its own
jurisdiction and “the courts of no country execute
the penal laws of another.”<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p>The suability of a State involves its sovereignty
and its honor and good faith. The constitutional
law of America is that a State in the Union cannot be
compelled to perform its contracts, although attempts
on its part to avoid them may be judicially resisted,
and State laws impairing the obligation of contracts
are void. Yet the legislative department of a State
represents its polity and its will and by every principle
of justice is called upon to hold public obligations
inviolate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Any departure from this rule, except for reasons most
cogent (of which the Legislature and not the courts, is
the judge) never fails in the end to incur the odium of the
world, and to bring lasting injury upon the State itself.
But to deprive the Legislature of the power of judging
what the honor and safety of the State may require,
even at the expense of a temporary failure to discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
the public debts, would be attended with greater evils
than such failure can cause.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p></blockquote>

<p>118. The judicial power of the United States
extends, under the Constitution to controversies
between <em>citizens of different States</em> and the Judiciary
Act confers jurisdiction strictly within the meaning
of the term.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

<p><dfn>States</dfn>, as the word is used in the Constitution,
means only members of the Union; a Territory is not
a State; the citizen of a Territory is not a citizen of a
State and any controversy at law which he may
have with another person is not “a controversy
between citizens of different States,” and therefore
does not come within the judicial jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
United States. Of course the limitation applies to
artificial persons,—corporations created by a State.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A corporation is not a citizen of the State and it cannot
maintain a suit in a court of the United States against
the citizen of a different State from that by which it was
chartered, unless the persons who compose the corporate
body are all citizens of that State.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The jurisdiction of American courts is co-extensive
with the power that creates them. Thus the jurisdiction
of federal courts depends in no way upon
the State, and State judges “possess an absolute
independence of the United States.”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Constitution has proceeded upon a theory of its
own, and given or withheld powers according to the
judgment of the American people, by whom it was
adopted. We (<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</i> the Supreme Court) can only construe
its powers, and cannot inquire into the policy or principles
which induced the grant of them. The Constitution has
presumed (whether rightly or wrongly we do not inquire)
that State attachments, State prejudices, State jealousies,
and State interests, might sometimes obstruct, or control,
or be supposed to obstruct or control, the regular administration
of justice. Hence, in controversies between
States; between citizens of different States; between
citizens claiming grants under different States; between a
State and its citizens, or foreigners, and between citizens
and foreigners, it enables the parties, under the authority
of Congress, to have the controversies heard, tried, and
determined before the national tribunals. No other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
reason than that which has been stated can be assigned,
why some, at least, of these cases should not have been
left to the cognizance of the State courts. In respect to
the other enumerated cases—the cases arising under the
Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United States,
cases affecting ambassadors and other public ministers,
and cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction—reasons
of a higher and more extensive nature, touching
the safety, peace, and sovereignty of the nation, might
well justify a grant of exclusive legislation.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">From the principle here given it may be deduced that
cases or controversies in State courts are removable
from them into federal courts if the case or controversy
involves the Constitution, a treaty or an
act of Congress.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>But a prisoner in custody under the authority of a
State should not, except in a case of peculiar urgency, be
discharged by a court or judge of the United States upon a
writ of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i>, in advance of any proceedings in
the courts of the State to test the validity of his arrest or
detention.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
119. A federal court sitting within a State is a
court of that State within the meaning of the Constitution
and laws of the Union, “and as such, has
an equal right with the State courts to fix the construction
of the local law.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> A State tribunal’s
decision must conform to that of the Supreme Court
of the United States, but a federal court sitting
within a State follows the highest State tribunal
unless the decision of that tribunal has been set
aside by the Supreme Court. Such procedure
“tends to preserve harmony in the exercise of the
judicial power, in the State and federal tribunals.”
This means that the statute law of a State,—and a
fixed and received construction by a State in its
own courts, makes a part of the statute law,—is
accepted by the federal courts sitting in the State.
But the federal court there is not bound to follow
such State precedents and authorities; the court
possesses a jurisdiction independent of that conferred
by State authority.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> Thus it may be stated
as accepted American constitutional law that where
there are two co-ordinate jurisdictions, and especially
“with regard to the law of real estate and
the construction of State constitutions and statutes”
and where are concerned “the doctrines of commercial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
law and general jurisprudence” the federal
courts sitting in a State exercise their own judgment,
“but even in such cases, for the sake of harmony
and to avoid confusion, the federal courts will lean
towards an agreement of views with the State courts,
if the question seems to them balanced with doubt.”<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>To the extent that a federal court sitting within a
State follows State laws and decisions, to that extent
is there a common law of the United States. There
is, however, no national common or customary law
of the United States; its law is statutory. But the
interpretation of the Constitution by the judicial
power of the United States</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions
are framed in the language of the English common law,
and are to be read in the light of its history. The code
of constitutional and statutory construction which,
therefore, is gradually formed by the judgments of (the
Supreme) Court, in the application of the Constitution
and the laws and treaties made in pursuance thereof,
has for its basis so much of the common law as may be
implied in the subject, and constitutes a common law
resting on national authority.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF STATE COMITY, TERRITORIES AND POSSESSIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>120. The States comprising the Union possess
equal powers and are subject to the same limitations.
This means, in brief, that they have, respectively,
the same jurisdiction. The sovereignty of one
State is equal to the sovereignty of another. Because
of this equality, they are all subject to the same rules
of State comity. The aspects of this mutual equality
are numerous and are the subject of provisions of the
Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>In so far as a State possesses jurisdiction it may
exercise authority.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> This rule is fundamental in
American constitutional law. The Constitution of
the United States confers no new power of jurisdiction
by simply regulating the effect of the acknowledged
jurisdiction over persons and things within a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
State.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Thus a State cannot make its law valid in
another State; the validity of a State law depends
upon the will of the State in which the validity is
claimed. From this it follows that “the jurisdiction
of any (State) court exercising authority over a
subject (<abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</abbr>, persons or property) may be inquired
into in every other (State) court when the proceedings
in the former are relied upon and brought before
the latter by a party claiming the benefit of such
proceedings.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p>So, despite the fourth article of the Constitution
as to “full faith and credit,” and “public acts,
records, and judicial proceedings” in the several
States, “a judgment rendered in any State may be
questioned in a collateral proceeding in another
State.”<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p>121. This principle is disclosed by examination
of the States as civil and political entities, for:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is equally well settled that the several States of the
Union are to be considered in this respect as foreign to
each other, and that the courts of one State are not
presumed to know, and therefore, not bound to take
judicial notice of the laws of another State.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
Therefore, whenever it becomes necessary for a
court of one State, in order to give full faith and
credit to a judgment rendered in another State, to
ascertain the effect which it has in that State, the
law of that State must be proved, like any other
fact.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>But national courts are bound to take notice
without proof of the laws of each of the States.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a>
The principle is thus laid down by Chief Justice
Marshall: “The laws of a foreign nation, designed
only for the direction of its own affairs, are not to
be noticed by the courts of other countries, unless
proved as facts.”<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> For national purposes embraced
by the Constitution, the States and their citizens
are one, united under the same sovereign authority,
and governed by the same laws. In all other respects
the States are necessarily foreign to and independent
of each other,—their constitutions and forms of
government being, although republican, altogether
different, as are their laws and institutions.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> In
government, jurisdiction is co-extensive with sovereignty.
Faith, credit, public acts, records, or judicial
proceedings that are valid in a State are, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
proved, valid in every other State, and Congress
possesses the power to prescribe by general laws the
manner and the effect of proof. This supreme power
is incidental, as well as necessary, to national
sovereignty as realized in “the more perfect Union.”<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>122. The citizens of each State are entitled to all
privileges and immunities of citizens in the several
States.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> But a corporation is not a citizen, being but
an artificial person created by the Legislature and
possessing only the powers and attributes which
the Legislature has prescribed.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> This conclusion is
inevitable from the principle of jurisdiction. No
State can create or give powers to a corporation in
another State, or powers that will be valid there.
A corporation created by a Legislature has powers
and privileges only within the jurisdiction of that
Legislature; or, as is said: “The corporation being
the mere creation of local law, can have no legal
existence beyond the limits of the sovereignty where
created.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> Thus a State may admit or exclude
foreign corporations, and the corporation cannot
maintain a claim of citizenship to right to enter the
State.</p>

<p>123. The words “privileges and immunities of
citizens” are of comprehensive meaning as determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
by the courts from time to time as issues
(cases or controversies) come before them. The
clause in the Constitution</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">plainly and unmistakably secures and protects the right
of a citizen of one State to pass into any other State of
the Union for the purpose of enjoying in lawful commerce,
trade, or business, without molestation; to acquire
personal property; to take and hold real estate; to maintain
actions in the courts of the State, and to be exempt
from any higher taxes or excises than are imposed by the
State upon its own citizens.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Or, as the principle is further stated: the sole purpose
of the constitutional provision is</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">to declare to the several States, that whatever those
rights (<abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</abbr>, the rights of citizens of that State),—as you
grant or establish them to your own citizens, or as you
limit or qualify, or impose restrictions on their exercise,
the same, neither more nor less, shall be the measure of
the rights of citizens of other States within your own
jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But the citizen from another State must comply
with the laws of the State into which he comes
before he can have the protection of its sovereignty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Constitution forbids only such legislation affecting
citizens of the respective States as will substantially
or practically put a citizen of one State in a condition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
alienage when he is within, or when he removes to,
another State, or when asserting in another State the
rights that commonly appertain to those who are part of
the political community known as the People of the
United States, by and for whom the government of the
Union was ordained and established.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p></blockquote>

<p>124. The test here is jurisdiction. No State has
jurisdiction that is denied it by the Constitution of
the United States. Each State has power so far as its
jurisdiction, or sovereignty, extends, to declare what
shall be offences against its laws, and citizens of other
States within its jurisdiction are subject to those
laws.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<p>Fugitives from justice escaping from a State or
Territory to another are subject to extradition.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>
Upon the Executive of the State or Territory in
which the accused is found rests the responsibility of
determining, in some legal mode, whether he is a
fugitive from the justice of the demanding State.
It is within the jurisdiction of the State or Territory
into which the accused has fled to demand competent
proof that he is in fact a fugitive from the demanding
State; otherwise the jurisdiction of the demanding
State would extend over the State or Territory into
which the accused has fled. But such proof being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
established, the accused “shall be delivered up” as
the federal Constitution prescribes.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> The principle
here is that of State jurisdiction as limited by the
supreme law.</p>

<p>125. But the question of powers, or rights, by extradition,
raises the question of right of asylum. Do</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">the States of the Union occupy towards each other, in
respect to fugitives from justice, the relation of foreign
nations, in the same sense in which the general government
stands towards independent sovereignties, on that
subject; and, in the further assumption that a fugitive
from justice acquires in the State to which he may flee
some State or personal right of protection, improperly
called a right of asylum, which secures to him exemption
from trial and punishment for a crime committed in
another State, unless such crime is made the special
object or ground of his rendition?<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p></blockquote>

<p>To answer this question in the affirmative is to
violate the sole object of the Constitution and acts of
Congress concerning the surrender of fugitives from
justice. Foreign nations stand in treaty relations
with the United States and with each other. The
States composing the American Union do not stand,
and by the Constitution, cannot stand in treaty
relations with one another or with any other State
or power.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
126. A fugitive from a foreign nation seeking
refuge in the United States is not extraditable unless
by the terms of the treaty between that nation and
the United States. There is nothing in the Constitution,
or in the Statutes at large of the United States
in reference to interstate rendition of fugitives from
justice which can be regarded as establishing any
compact between the States of the Union (such as
a treaty between the United States and another
nation does or may contain), limiting their operation
to particular or designated offenses. And it is
questionable whether the States, or any of them,
could constitutionally enter into any agreement or
stipulation one with another for the purpose of
defining or limiting the offenses for which fugitives
would or should be surrendered. “The plain answer
is that the laws of the United States do not recognize
any right of asylum on the part of the fugitive from
justice in any State to which he has fled.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> The
principle here laid down finds further explication:
To apply the rule of international, or foreign extradition
to interstate rendition involves the confusion of
two essentially different things, which rest upon
entirely different principles.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> In the former, the
extradition depends upon treaty contract, or stipulation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
which rests upon good faith, and in respect to
which the sovereign upon whom the demand is made
can exercise discretion, as well as investigate the
charge on which the surrender is demanded, there
being no rule of comity under and by nature of which
independent nations are required or expected to
withhold from fugitives within their jurisdiction the
right of asylum. In the matter of interstate rendition,
however, there is the binding force and obligation,
not of contract, but of the supreme law of the
land, which imposes no conditions, or limitations,
upon the jurisdiction and authority of the State to
which the fugitive is returned.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>127. The decision as to whether a State possesses
a republican form of government,—or what government
in a State is the lawful government rests with
the political, not the judicial power. “It is the
province of the court to expound the law, not to
make it.”<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> Thus the courts follow the political
authority.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the case of foreign nations, the government acknowledged
by the President is always recognized in the
courts of justice; and this principle has been applied, by
the act of Congress, to the sovereign States of the Union.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">If the President errs, it is within the power of Congress
to apply the proper remedy. “The sovereignty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
in every State resides in the people of that State,
and they may alter and change their form of government
at their own pleasure.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> But the United
States guarantees to each a republican form of
government.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> “No particular government is designated
as republican, neither is the exact form to be
guaranteed in any manner especially designated.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">The guarantee necessarily implies a duty on the part of
the States themselves to provide such a government.
All the States had governments when the Constitution
was adopted. In all, the people participated to some
extent, through their representatives elected in the
manner specially provided. These governments the
Constitution did not change. They were accepted
precisely as they were, and it is, therefore, to be presumed
that they were such as it was the duty of the States to
provide. Thus we have unmistakable evidence of what
was republican in form, within the meaning of that
term, as employed in the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Conformably with the character of this federal
guarantee of the republican form, the Supreme Court
has decided that:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Constitution the term <dfn>State</dfn> most frequently
expresses the combined idea ... of people, territory,
and government. A <em>State</em>, in the ordinary sense of the
Constitution, is a political community of free citizens,
occupying a territory of defined boundaries, and organized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
under a government sanctioned and limited by a
written constitution, and established by the consent of
the governed. It is the union of such States, under a
common Constitution, which forms the distinct and
greater political unit, which that Constitution designates
as the United States, and makes of the people and States,
which compose it, one people and one country....
The preservation of the States, and the maintenance of
their government, are as much within the design and
care of the Constitution as the preservation of the Union
and the maintenance of the national government. The
Constitution, in all of its provisions, looks to an indestructible
Union of indestructible States.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The constitutional rules of State comity are
therefore rules of national jurisdiction, and operate as
limitations on the jurisdiction of the several States.
The purpose of these rules, as that of every rule
of that jurisdiction is essentially to preserve that
jurisdiction, or sovereignty,—and is sufficiently indicated
in the Preamble to the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a></p>

<p>128. The admission of a new State into the Union
is a political act exclusively within the power of
Congress, save that no new State shall be erected
within the jurisdiction, or by the conjunction, of
States or parts of States, without the consent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Legislatures of the States concerned, as well as of
Congress.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> This entire act is exclusively political,
but the State once admitted into the Union comes
within the jurisdiction of the United States as the
Constitution provides.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> The State thus admitted
becomes entitled to and possesses all rights of
sovereignty and dominion,—that is, rights of jurisdiction,
which belonged to the original States.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

<p>129. The act enabling the inhabitants of a Territory
to adopt a constitution and become a State
in the Union usually prescribes that the proposed
constitution and government shall be republican in
form, shall make no distinction in civil or political
rights on account of race or color, shall not be repugnant
to the Constitution of the United States, or to
the principles of the Declaration of Independence,
and shall comply with such conditions as Congress
at the time may propose.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> On June 16, 1906,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Congress passed an enabling act under which, four
years later, Arizona sought admission into the Union.
The new constitution submitted to Congress provided
for state-wide recall of State officials. To this provision
Congress objected and made the admission
of the Territory conditional upon the amendment of
its proposed constitution by eliminating the objectionable
provision. Arizona complied with the
congressional condition and was admitted; thereupon
speedily amended its constitution by re-inserting
the objectionable clauses. Congress has no
power to impose conditions, clauses, or provisions
upon the constitution of a State; yet, a provision of a
State constitution in conflict with the Constitution
of the United States is null and void.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p>130. As the Union is an indestructible Union of
indestructible States, it is a principle of American
constitutional law: once a State, always a State.
The inhabitants of a Territory having been erected
by Congress into inhabitants of a State, territorial
jurisdiction, created by act of Congress ceases, and
State jurisdiction exists. It is this State jurisdiction
in the Union which is indestructible, which can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
neither be extended, nor diminished by Congress.
The equality and equivalency of the States in the
Union is a fundamental in American constitutional
law. The jurisdiction of a Territory differs from that
of a State as a governed differs from a self-governing
community.</p>

<p>131. Congress has power “to make all needful
rules and regulations respecting the territory and
other property belonging to the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>
This means the power to govern, a power necessary
to sovereignty, and the “inevitable consequence of
the right to acquire territory; or, as the jurisdiction
over a Territory does not belong to any State in the
Union, its government lies by implication (if not by
necessity) with the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>In creating a territorial jurisdiction, Congress
exercises, but does not part with its powers. The
power to govern Territories is not conditioned. Such
Territories</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">are but political subdivisions of the outlying dominion of
the United States. Their relation to the general government
is much the same as that which counties bear to
the respective States, and Congress may legislate for
them as a State does for its municipal organizations.
The organic law (“enabling act”) for a Territory takes
the place of a constitution as the fundamental law of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
local government. It is obligatory on, and binds the
territorial authorities; but Congress is supreme, and for
the purposes of this department of its governmental
authority, has all the powers of the people of the United
States, except such as have been expressly, or by implication
reserved in the prohibitions of the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p></blockquote>

<p>132. Congress has full and complete legislative
authority over the people of the Territories, and all
departments of the territorial government. It may
do for the Territories what the people under the
Constitution of the United States may do for the
States. That the Supreme Court in 1901 gave a
new meaning to the jurisdiction of Congress over
territory belonging to the United States is now a
matter of history. By that decision the power to
govern is co-extensive with the power to acquire
territory,—and this means sovereignty. Territorial
acquisitions are wholly subject to the will of Congress.
It may govern them as it sees fit. States, not
Territories, are guaranteed by the United States
“a republican form of government.” The word
“citizens” as used in the Constitution does not
include inhabitants of such Territories.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Constitution of the United States was ordained
and established by the people of the United States for
themselves, for their own government, and not for the
government of the individual States. Each State established
a constitution for itself, and, in that constitution,
provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers
of its particular government as its judgment dictated.
The people of the United States framed such a government
for the United States as they supposed best
adapted to their situation, and best calculated to promote
their interests. The powers they conferred on this
government were to be exercised by itself; and the limitations
on power, if expressed in general terms, are
naturally, and we think necessarily, applicable to the
government created by the instrument.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But the government thus formed under the Constitution
is the government of “the more perfect
Union,” which is an “indestructible Union of indestructible
States.” By constitutional law, indestructibility
is not a quality of any territory under
the jurisdiction of the United States.</p>

<p>133. The rights of the inhabitants of such territory
are determined by Congress. This power of
Congress seems unlimited, but the Supreme Court of
the United States disclaims “any intention to hold
that the inhabitants of these territories are subject
to an unrestrained power on the part of Congress to
deal with them upon the theory that they have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
rights which it is bound to respect.”<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> What limitation
then, if any, is there on Congress, in exercising
its powers over such territory?</p>

<p>The Court replies:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are certain principles of natural justice inherent
in the Anglo-Saxon character, which need no expression
in constitutions or statutes to give them effect to secure
dependencies against legislation manifestly hostile to
their real interests.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But the power of Congress to govern Territories,
(“dependencies,” “outlying possessions”) is, by
present constitutional law, exercisable at the will of
Congress.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> The essential matter is of jurisdiction.
The United States is a sovereignty; for some purposes
the several States comprising the Union are sovereign,<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a>
but according to American constitutional law,
a Territory, dependency, or outlying possession
belonging to the United States is not sovereign, and
possesses no powers, rights, privileges, or attributes
of sovereignty. The principle may be stated thus:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
To whatsoever extent Congress exercises jurisdiction,
to that extent it governs; its functions are legislative
and essentially political; to the extent that they are
political they are sovereign.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_X" class="vspace">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF LIMITATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>134. The government of the United States, as
also that of each State, is a government of limited
powers. In our day we speak of either government
as one of <em>limitations</em>; in the eighteenth century the
equivalent expression was “checks and balances.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>
Fundamentally, American constitutional law is the
law of constitutional limitations. These limitations
confront us at whatever point we consider American
law and government. Sovereignty,—the people of
the United States, or the people of a State,—has
never delegated all its powers to government, and
never any of them without limitations.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> Written
constitutions are limitations of delegated powers.
But powers delegated to what we commonly call a
department,—as the legislative, the executive, or
the judicial,—are sufficient for the necessary and
proper performance of the functions (or as constitutional
law would say, “execution of the office”)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
of the department. This concept of the nature
of the grant of powers is fundamental; on no other
concept of power can government in America be
operated.</p>

<p>It remains then to know the scope and character
of these checks and balances,—these
limitations,—which, however obscure, distinguish
constitutional law and government in America. In
the federal system, the government of the United
States is balanced against that of the States, the
office, or function of the one, operating as a limitation
on the office or function of the other. This, unquestionably,
is the essential, or principal limitation
in the American civil system. It discloses itself in
the frequent question whether a public service shall
be done by the United States or by the State,—touching
such matters as public health, public
safety, public morals, commerce, labor, and others.
Here there always is the question of authority,
whether it is State or federal, and, if any, to what
extent? And if there is limitation, is it of State
authority by federal, or of federal authority by
State,—or, is it of both by fundamental limitations?</p>

<p>Passing the mutual limitation of the two governments,
we come to limitations of each, and these
limitations are similar. Powers of the Senate counterbalance
powers of the House; powers of the Legislative
counterbalance those of the Executive; powers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Judicial counterbalance powers of the Executive
and the Legislative. If the President nominates,
the Senate may refuse to conform; if he negotiates
a treaty, the Senate may refuse to ratify it. If
President or federal Judge fails to execute his
office, the House may impeach, and the Senate
convict of “high crimes and misdemeanors.” If
members of Senate or House fail to satisfy their
constituents, these may elect other men as their
successors. No office in the American system of
government is for life, though it may be for good
behavior. Lincoln states the whole case:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the frame of government under which we live,
this same people have wisely given their public servants
but little power for mischief; and have, with equal wisdom,
provided for the return of that little into their own
hands at very short intervals. While the people retain
their virtue and vigilance, no administration by any
extreme of wickedness or folly, can very seriously injure
the government in the short space of four years.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p></blockquote>

<p>135. Of checks on the Executive there are three:
concerning his election; concerning his powers, or
office, and concerning his removal from office. He
is elected by a few persons, technically called
“electors.”<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Each State appointing as its Legislature
may direct as many “electors” as the whole number
of its Senators and Representatives to which it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
entitled in Congress. Popular election of these
“electors” is, in constitutional law, their appointment
by the State legislatures. The so-called popular
vote is unknown to the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a></p>

<p>The method of deciding disputed presidential
elections, provided in the Constitution, was modified
by adoption of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804.
The Amendment means that if the decision is not
made by the presidential electors by a certain time,
the election shall go to the House of Representatives,
in case of the President; and to the Senate, in case
of the Vice-President. The vote in the House is
by States; the Senators represent States. Thus the
States, at a critical time, become the check on the
United States in the selection of President and
Vice-President.</p>

<p>That the President (and by implication, the Vice-President)
must be native-born American citizens is a
constitutional limitation of candidacy.</p>

<p>136. Of limitation of executive powers, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
exception of the pardoning power in cases of impeachment,
and of command of the State militia save
when called into the actual service of the United
States<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> are specified,—or, as commonly stated in
legal language,—“expressed,” not “implied.” So
too is the limitation of the President’s appointing
power during recess of the Senate,—the appointee’s
commission expiring “at the end of the next session.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
What limitations of executive power are implied in
the Constitution is largely a matter of political
interpretation. The practical question here is of
confusion of functions, or offices. Thus the Executive
may not exercise legislative or judicial functions.
This conforms to the theory of separation of governmental
functions expressed or implied in every
American constitution.</p>

<p>Yet Congress may impose duties upon the President
which are essentially legislative, as, for example,
by empowering him to suspend, by proclamation,
the collection of duties on articles from a nation
which, by reciprocity, has suspended collection of
duties on certain imports from the United States.
Does the President in such a case transcend executive
office?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The true distinction is between the delegation of
power to make the law, which necessarily involves a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
discretion as to what it shall be,—and conferring authority,
or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under
and in pursuance of the law. The first cannot be done;
to the latter no valid objection can be made.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A very large proportion of the bills presented to
Congress originate in the executive department.
But Judge Ranney’s distinction (stated above)
expresses the essential difference: it is Congress
that determines what the law shall be. The bill, or
measure, proposed, may come from a private citizen,
or a State Legislature, or a railroad directorate, or the
War Department, or a Committee of the House, or
from some other source: it is Congress alone that
can make it law. There is, however, a powerful
check on the Executive as suggesting legislation:
the check of public opinion, of custom, of precedent.
These and like checks are sometimes called the
limitations of the unwritten constitution.</p>

<p>137. The third check on the Executive is of removal
from office for cause, by impeachment, in
which procedure the House, the Senate, and the
Chief Justice of the United States have definite
offices.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> Practically this check is utilized on political<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
grounds; therefore it cannot be measured strictly as
a process in law, although it is under a procedure
distinctively in constitutional law. The check on
the election of the Executive is essentially political,
but that on the pardoning power, and on the command
of the State militia is not political: yet all
these checks, or limitations, are constitutional.</p>

<p>138. The constitutional limitations of the power
of Congress,—checks on federal legislative power,—include
term of service, qualifications for office, and
authority in legislation. The large limitation is of
term of service: six years for Senators; two years
for Representatives. The people of the United
States delegate legislative powers to Congress for a
limited time. In an absolute monarchy there is no
legislative, nor is there a time limit on the monarch
as law-maker. Lincoln touched the vital spot when
he said that the people have given their public servants
but little power for mischief, having provided
for the return into their own hands at very short
intervals what little power they have delegated.
Were Congress a corporation, with perpetual charter,
and filling vacancies in its membership, it would, for
practical purposes, exercise the office of sovereignty
and would exercise power without limitation. The
delegation of legislative power by the people of the
United States is not to Senators or to Representatives,
but to Congress, consisting of a Senate and a House<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
of Representatives, and organized and proceeding
according to the Constitution. The question in
America is not alone, What will Congress do? but
also, What can Congress do?</p>

<p>139. The expressed limitations of the power of
Congress are that</p>

<p>(1) All duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform
throughout the United States.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>(2) No appropriations of money to raise and
support armies shall be for a longer period than two
years.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a></p>

<p>(3) Militia officers must be appointed by the
respective States.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>(4) No bill of attainder or <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i> law shall
be passed.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>(5) No tax or duty shall be laid on exports from
any State.<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p>(6) No discrimination shall be made as to ports
of entry or the regulation of shipping.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
(7) No title of nobility shall be granted by the
United States.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>(8) Neither House, during the session of Congress,
shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for
more than three days, nor to any other place than that
in which the two Houses shall be sitting.<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a></p>

<p>(9) Revenue bills shall originate in the House of
Representatives.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p>(10) No Senator or Representative, during the
time for which he is elected, can be appointed to any
civil office under the United States, which shall have
been created, or the emoluments of which shall have
been increased during such time; and no person holding
any office under the United States shall be a member
of either House during his continuance in office.<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></p>

<p>(11) No act of Congress concerning treason can
provide for conviction “unless on the testimony of
two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession
in open court.”<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>(12) A bill of attainder of treason is not a bill of
attainder, but no bill of attainder of treason shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during
the life of the person attained.<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>(13) A new State cannot be erected within the
jurisdiction of another State, or be formed by the
junction of two or more States, or parts of States,
without consent of their respective legislatures.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a></p>

<p>(14) The power of Congress to make rules and
regulations respecting the territory or other property
belonging to the United States cannot be exercised
so as to prejudice the claims of any particular State.<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a></p>

<p>140. While the limitations thus far cited are
specific and expressed, they go less to the fundamentals
of government and civil rights than do other
limitations expressed in the Constitution, and
notably in the Amendments.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>It is not unusual that a State constitution declares
that to guard against transgressions of the high
powers of government delegated by the people
through them, everything in the article, commonly
known as the Bill of Rights, is excepted out of the
general powers of government, and shall forever
remain inviolate. The first ten Amendments of
the Constitution are its Bill of Rights, and are a
limitation not only of legislative powers but also of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
executive powers vested in the President, and of
judicial powers vested in the Supreme and inferior
courts of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<p>As respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging
freedom of speech or the press, or the right of the
people peaceably to assemble and to petition to
government for a redress of grievances, Congress can
make no law whatever.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>Nor can Congress infringe the right of the people
to keep and bear arms, or violate their right to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, or
pass any law holding a person to answer for a capital
or otherwise infamous crime unless on presentment
or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising
in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in
the actual service of the United States in time of
war, or public danger; or pass any law compelling
any person to be subject for the same offence twice to
be put in jeopardy of life or limb, or be compelled
in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,
or be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law; or pass any law taking private
property for public use without just compensation.<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a></p>

<p>The practical effect of the limitations expressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in the Fifth Amendment can be known only by judicial
interpretation, and decision of cases instituted
under it; no theoretical definition can anticipate
these decisions of the Supreme Court. The principle
involved is the protection of certain fundamental
rights of the people. In a similar manner do the
Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments guard
fundamental rights and limit the legislative power
delegated to Congress by the people of the United
States. This means that Congress has no power to
deny or to disparage rights enumerated in these
Amendments which are, as a group, enumerative of
rights at common law. Nor are the rights enumerated,
or set forth, in the Constitution as (practically)
excepted out of the powers of government, and forever
inviolate, the only rights which Congress, in
exercising its powers, is inhibited from violating.
Other and unmentioned rights of the people are
distinctly implied,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> as retained by them, and the
Tenth Amendment is a general limitation of Congress,
President, and Courts, for it declares that “The
powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are
reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.”<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a></p>

<p>141. The line of demarcation between powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
delegated and powers reserved has always been, and
doubtless always will be, in dispute. The question
involved is political as well as constitutional. The
abolition of slavery by the Thirteenth Amendment
excludes pro-slavery legislation of any kind affecting
the United States or any place subject to its jurisdiction.
In like manner the Fourteenth Amendment
forbids Congress, or any State, to assume or pay any
debt, or obligation incurred in aid of insurrection or
rebellion against the United States, or any claim for
the loss or emancipation of any slave. All these
limitations of legislative power are practical guides
and measurements by which the judicial power,—the
law courts,—can determine what the law is, whether
the act of Congress conflicts with the Constitution.
It is largely through these expressed limitations that
the judiciary becomes a check on the legislative.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>142. The limitations of the powers of the States
are numerous and specific. As to limitations of
State power (<abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</abbr>, the power of the State government,
executive, legislative, judicial, administrative), within
State jurisdiction, the several State constitutions
alone are authoritative and final.<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> The Union is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
indestructible Union of indestructible States, yet the
States composing the Union are under limitations
as members of that Union. Except as to the places
of choosing senators, Congress may at any time
prescribe the times, places, and manner of holding
elections of senators and representatives.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over the
District of Columbia, and over places purchased
from any State, and over federal property.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p>But the Constitution enumerates limitations of
the States, each of which eliminates sovereignty from
the State and all together, with some other limitations,
reduce a State to what Hamilton, in <cite>The
Federalist</cite> calls “residuary sovereignty.”<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation;
grant letters of marque or reprisal; coin
money; emit bills of credit; make anything but gold and
silver coin a tender in payment of debts; pass any bill
of attainder, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i>, law, or law impairing the
obligation of contracts, or grant any title of nobility.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
These limitations are of power usually classed as
sovereign. Of similar scope are the limitations,
prescribed by the Constitution, of State power of
taxation,—that is, of laying imposts or duties; of
keeping troops or ships of war; of entering into any
agreement with another State, or with a foreign
power; of engaging in war, unless actually invaded,
or in imminent danger of invasion, not admitting
of delay. None of these powers can a State
in the Union exercise without the consent of
Congress.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>143. When called into the actual service of the
United States, the State militia are under the control
of the President,—a limitation of the power of
the State executives.<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> The Supreme Court of the
United States has original jurisdiction in all cases in
which a State is a party,<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> except in cases commenced
or prosecuted against a State by citizens of another
State, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign
State, in which cases the judicial power of the United
States has no jurisdiction whatever.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> Neither
slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime whereof the party shall have
been duly convicted shall exist in a State.<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a> No State
shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
States; or deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,
without due process of law, or deny to any
person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of
the laws.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a> Denial of the right to vote by a State to
electors qualified as electors by the Constitution of
the United States shall work a proportional loss in the
basis of representation in Congress from that State.
No State shall assume or pay any debt or obligation
incurred in aid of insurrection or rebellion against
the United States, or any claim for the loss or emancipation
of any slave.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> A little reflection will lead
one to the conclusion that these limitations on the
States, provided in the Constitution of the United
States, are essential to the existence of the Union.</p>

<p>144. On the other hand, the States are recognized
as checks and balances, as limitations on the United
States, by the Constitution:</p>

<p>(1) Representatives are apportioned among the
several States, but each State shall have at least one
Representative,<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> and no State can be deprived of its
equal suffrage in the Senate without its own consent.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a></p>

<p>(2) The State executive alone has authority to issue
writs of election to fill vacancies in the representation
of a State.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p>(3) Each State appoints presidential electors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives
to which it is entitled in Congress.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a></p>

<p>(4) In case of a disputed election of President or
Vice-President, the Vice-President is chosen by the
Senate,—the President, by the House of Representatives,
the vote in the House being by States, each
State having one vote, a quorum for this purpose
consisting of a member or members, from two thirds
of the States, and a majority of all the States being
necessary to a choice.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a></p>

<p>(5) The States, as represented in the Senate, have
power to confirm or to reject (two thirds of the senators
present concurring) treaties and nominations to
office submitted to it by the President.<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a></p>

<p>(6) No State can be divided, nor can a new State
be erected within a State without its own consent.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>(7) Each State is guaranteed a republican form
of government by the United States, and protection
against invasion, and (on application of its Legislature,
or of its Executive) against domestic violence.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a></p>

<p>(8) The Legislatures of two thirds of the States
may call a convention for amending the Constitution;
but no amendment becomes part of the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
until ratified by the Legislatures of three
fourths of the States, or by Conventions in three
fourths of them, as the one or the other mode may be
proposed by Congress.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> In this procedure of amending
the Constitution, the several States are equal. A
proposed amendment may be ratified and become
part of the Constitution by the approval of three
fourths of the States irrespective of their respective
area, population, wealth, or any other mark or
quality.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> Finally, both as conferring benefits, and
as prescribing the fundamental limitations on the
States and on the United States, the Constitution
and the laws and treaties made in pursuance thereof
comprise “the supreme law of the land,” and all
officials “both of the United States and of the several
States shall be bound by oath or affirmation to support
it, anything in the constitution or laws of any
State to the contrary notwithstanding.”<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a></p>

<p>The character of this supremacy of the “law
of the land” is indicated in the Constitution itself:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
“The powers not delegated to the United States
by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the
States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to
the people.”<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> The fundamental character of the
limitations which this provision establishes is seen
as it affects the common interests of life. These
interests include domestic relations, ordinary business
transactions, recognized by common law; the
ownership, acquisition, administration, and distribution
of estates; peace and good order within the
State; schools and education; the erection and care
of public highways; personal liberty, freedom of
worship, freedom of speech and of the press. These
and cognate interests are within the scope and power
of the State, and not, unless control over them is
specially delegated, within the scope and power of
the United States.</p>

<p>In truth, excepting in the election of United States
Senators, members of the House of Representatives,
and Presidential Electors, the citizen does not
participate in federal government; and save through
the post office, the customs, the income tax (which
directly affects fewer than half a million persons in
the United States), and in banking (including the
use of the money of the country) the citizen rarely
has anything to do with the United States. On
the other hand, in the protection of his property,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
the education of his family, the right of use of highways,
the validation of contracts, the rights, privileges
and use of multitudinous relations safeguarded
by the common law and the statute, it is the State,
not the United States, which has first place, and,
consequently, constitutional priority.</p>

<p>The exact line of division between State and
federal powers is not known. The principle which
rules in every attempt to fix this line is that the
enumeration of rights and powers in a constitution,—State
or federal,—“shall not be construed to deny or
disparage others retained by the people”<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> of the
State or of the United States.</p>

<p>145. The essential doctrine, here, is set forth by
the Supreme Court in a decision which gives almost
unlimited power to Congress in certain cases (its
power over a Territory, or possession of the United
States):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are certain principles of natural justice inherent
in the Anglo-Saxon character which need no expression in
constitutions or statutes to give them effect, or to secure
dependencies against legislation manifestly hostile to
their real interests.... The wisdom and discretion of
Congress, their identity with the people, and the influence
which their constituents possess at elections, are in this,
as in many other instances,—as that for example, of
declaring war,—the sole restraints on which they have
relied to secure them from its abuse. They are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
<em>restraints on which the people must often solely rely in all
representative government</em>.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The limitation of powers delegated by the people
of the United States, in the federal Constitution, or
of a State, in its constitution, implies a delegation of
powers adequate to performance of legitimate civil
functions. The large question involved in every
case of a constitutional nature, or constitutional
construction, is whether in the discharge of a function,
or an office, the government, or any department
of it is transcending its delegated powers.
This question is of the essence of constitutional law
and judicial interpretation.</p>

<p>146. The people interpret their will in their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
election of executive, legislative, or judiciary, and
the elective system prevails for all three in most of
the States.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> The courts interpret the laws in course
of performance of their judicial duties, and their
interpretation conforms to principles of justice.
Thus in addition to the popular restraint, through
frequent elections,—there is judicial restraint, or
limitation of legislative and executive (but strictly
ministerial) powers.<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> The entire case, as to the
relation of the judiciary to the legislative, is covered
by the rule laid down by the Supreme Court: “It
is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> This duty is of
State judges as well as federal, for all American judges
are alike bound by oath to support the Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>
Any American judge has jurisdiction to pronounce
as to the constitutionality of an act of Congress or
of a State legislature. The essential fact necessary
in such pronouncement is that the validity of the
law is vital to the real interests of a party to the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
or controversy before the court. The decision of the
court is not an <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obiter dictum</i>, a mere philosophical
opinion, so-called, of the judges, individually, or
collectively, based on an interpretation of justice.
The constitutionality of the law in question must be
an essential part of the issue before the court.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whenever, in pursuance of an honest and actual
antagonistic assertion of rights by one individual against
another there is presented a question involving the validity
of any act of any Legislature, State or federal, and
the decision necessarily rests on the competency of the
Legislature to so enact, the court must, in the exercise
of its solemn duties, determine whether the act is constitutional
or not; but such an exercise of power is the
ultimate and supreme function of courts. It is legitimate
only in the last resort, and as a necessity in the determination
of real, earnest, and vital controversy between
individuals. It never was the thought that by means
of a friendly suit, a party beaten in the Legislature could
transfer to the courts an inquiry as to the constitutionality
of the legislative act.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The principle of constitutional interpretation is
given by Chief Justice Marshall:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope
of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate,
which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the
Constitution, are constitutional.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p></blockquote>

<p>And he develops the principle further:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But where the law is not prohibited, and is really
calculated to effect any of the objects entrusted to the
government, to undertake (in courts of law) to inquire
into the degree of its necessity would be to pass the line
which circumscribes the judicial department, and to
tread on legislative ground.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></p></blockquote>

<p>147. The American constitutions are expressed
and implied, limitations of governmental powers,
though popularly considered as grants of such powers.
“The truth is,” wrote Hamilton in <cite>The Federalist</cite>,
“the Constitution is itself, in every rational sense,
and to every useful purpose, a Bill of Rights.” It is
“the Bill of Rights of the Union.” It declares and
specifies “the political privileges of the citizens in the
structure and administration of the government.”
It “defines certain immunities and modes of proceeding
which are relative to personal and private
concerns.” It comprehends “various precautions
for the public security which are not to be found
in any of the State constitutions.”<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> James Wilson
agreed with Hamilton that the Constitution is itself
a Bill of Rights, remarking, in reply to the objection
that the Constitution as it left the hands of its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
framers and went to the country had no Bill of
Rights:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A Bill of Rights would have been improperly annexed
to the federal plan (<abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">i. e.</abbr>, the Constitution, 1787), and
for this plain reason that it would imply that whatever
is not expressed was given, which is not the principle
of the proposed Constitution.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As constitutions are the most solemn form of
limitations of governmental powers, their interpretation
determines the whole character of the government.
The principle of constitutional interpretation
is that</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">words are to be understood in that sense in which they
are generally used by those for whom the instrument
was intended; its provisions are neither to be restricted
into insignificance, nor extended to objects not comprehended
in them, nor contemplated by its founders.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The effect of the judicial pronouncement of the
unconstitutionality of a law is to make it “in legal
contemplation, as inoperative as if it had never been
passed.”<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
148. To whatsoever extent State or federal
officials perform ministerial functions they are
answerable to the judiciary for their acts. Ministerial
officers comprise the vast body of appointees
in the States and in the United States. They are
not executive officers, for such perform functions
distinctively outside judicial investigation, but as
distinctively within the political powers of the legislature.
The judiciary is a powerful limitation of
ministerial powers, in the sense that the performance
of those powers is examinable in courts of law.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a></p>

<p>In the popular mind the veto power may seem to
be the principal executive check on legislation. This
conviction takes form in State constitutions<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> which
authorize the Governor to veto any item in an
appropriation bill, or to cut the item down.</p>

<p>One result of this popular conviction is acquiescence
in exercise of executive power which, in former
times would have been interpreted by the people
as “executive usurpation.” At present the people
rely upon their executives,—Governors, Presidents,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>—to
act as a check,—a limitation,—on unwise legislation.
This reliance, or expectation, is a powerful
element in practical politics. Thus the limitations
of government in America are threefold: first, the
American constitutions themselves; secondly, frequent
popular elections, and thirdly, the judiciary
in its interpretation of constitutions and laws.
These limitations are constitutional limitations.
There is a fourth limitation but it belongs to another
sphere,—the sphere of politics.<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a></p>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>149. The people of the several States, and the
people of the United States, have delegated powers
to the governments which they have respectively
created. The powers thus delegated are general, or
special. Doubtless the special are implied in the
general, but in order to secure precision, and thus
to mark off, in practical fashion, the boundaries
of the grants, the delegation of a power, or the
reservation of a power is declared as clearly as
possible in language of adjudicated meaning, or
capable of interpretation according to such meaning.</p>

<p>In the American constitutions, both federal and
State, many provisions are administrative, that is,
prescriptive of method, or procedure, as the strictly
parliamentary provisions on the legislative respecting
sessions, the journal, the quorum, adjournments,
the method of passing bills, and the like. In the
article on the judiciary, in State constitutions,
provisions are found concerning appeals, writs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
minor court officials, sessions of courts, records,
decisions, and the like, all of which are of secondary
importance as compared with the general grant of
judicial power.</p>

<p>In the executive article,—and notably in State
constitutions, all that does not strictly belong to the
executive office,—that is, to the distinctive functions
of the Governor, is administrative. In the Constitution
of the United States there is little of this administrative
matter formally expressed, but much by
implication,—for the appointees of the President
(excepting the federal judges) are administrative
officers, and the appointees of the President, of the
heads of departments, or of the courts of law,—constituting
what is known in law as “inferior
officers”<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> comprehends quite all persons in the
employ of the federal government.</p>

<p>In the State constitutions the important administrative
offices are usually named, as of treasurer,
auditor general, secretary of state, superintendent
of education, commissioner of labor, of insurance, of
agriculture, of railways, and the like. The duties of
persons elected to these offices are usually prescribed
in general terms. Their delegated powers are ascertainable
by judicial procedure. A little reflection
will make clear that most of the mere business of
government, State or federal, is carried on by administrative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
officials who number, in the aggregate,
in the United States quite a million. These persons
possess slight, if any discretionary authority; they
are ministerial public servants, and in the exercise
of authority vested in them they are all amenable
to judicial process.</p>

<p>150. That Congress, with delegated powers of
legislation, and exercising them as the representative
and agent of the sovereign people of the United
States, has power to lay and collect taxes, to coin
money, to declare war, to regulate commerce, and
to do other acts, whether or not these powers were
specifically conferred, can hardly be denied. The
exercise of such powers goes with the very existence
of government. An example is afforded by the decision
of the Supreme Court that the power of the
United States to acquire territory and to govern it
is an exercise of the war power.<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> The Court here
reasons from the general to the particular: from the
general grant of power to declare war to the particular
use of the power in governing an area of territory
acquired.</p>

<p>It might seem, then, that as the whole always
includes the part, and the general the particular,—the
necessary and essential thing to do in creating
government is merely to create it; for example, that
the people of the United States should ordain and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
establish a Constitution consisting of the Preamble,
which states the purpose and authority of the Constitution,
and three general articles:</p>

<p>Article I. The legislative power is vested in
Congress.</p>

<p>Article II. The executive power is vested in the
President.</p>

<p>Article III. The judicial power is vested in a
Court.</p>

<p>151. The Preamble and these three delegations
of power comprise the essentials of the Constitution,
lacking one other:</p>

<p>Article IV. The powers not delegated are reserved
to the States or to the people, and the enumeration
of certain rights in the Constitution shall
not be construed to deny or disparage others retained
by the people.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a></p>

<p>The rights thus retained, that is, <em>not delegated</em>,
are <em>fundamental rights</em>, are inviolate, and to guard
against transgressions of the high powers delegated
to government by the people are excepted out of the
general powers of government; and being excepted
out of the general powers, they are logically excepted
out of the particular.</p>

<p>Thus, in final analysis, constitutional law in America
is shaped and determined by interpretation of
these fundamental rights. The supreme law cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
violate them. They comprise the Bills of Rights, or
Declarations of Rights of the State constitutions and
the first ten amendments of the federal Constitution.</p>

<p>152. There is no fixed order of these rights or
priority among them. The Constitution, as framed
originally, forbade any religious test for any federal
office or trust.<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> The First Amendment forbids
Congress to make any law respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise
thereof. The limitation is wholly on Congress.
If any such exists for a State it is found in the constitution
of that State. Crime cannot be protected
under the claim or guise of being religion. Thus
polygamy, bigamy, or conduct, ceremonies or observance
criminal and offensive to the commonsense
of mankind cannot be tolerated.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a> Freedom of
religion cannot be made a cloak for immorality
or crime.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> The preservation of religious liberty is
largely a function of the States. The essentials
here are: the equality of religious establishments
before the law; “exemption of all persons from
compulsory support of religious worship and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
compulsory attendance upon the same”<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a>; freedom
of conscience and speech in religious matters, and
entire exemption of the person from discrimination,
domination, censorship, or interference in matters
of religion by the State.</p>

<p>But this fundamental right does not free the person
from responsibility to the State for the results
of his belief or conduct, in so far as either imperils
the State. Thus, so-called “religious belief” or conduct
which destroys or endangers peace and good
order, or the life, or lives, or reputation of a person
or a community cannot work exemption under
the claim of religious liberty.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>Freedom of speech, of the press, and of assembling
are ancient rights, each won after long struggle
against absolutism.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> These rights are inviolable,
but the same principle applies to them as to religious
freedom: he who exercises them is responsible for the
abuse of the right.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
153. Every citizen is subject to the legislative
power of the State, and abuse of a fundamental
right,—as of freedom of speech or of the press in
uttering a libel,—cannot exempt the party from
prosecution. No man can make plea of a fundamental
right as making him “above the law.” The
law accords with the fundamental right.</p>

<p>The right to petition government for redress of
grievances<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> is essentially the right of freedom of
speech in a particular way. The right to keep and
bear arms is essentially the right to self-protection,
but this right may not be abused with impunity; it
does not empower any person to take the law into
his own hands, or to carry weapons.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> Carrying concealed
weapons is not an exercise of the right to
bear arms, unless in the performance of a function,
the execution of an office, in which case such carrying
is permitted (licensed) by the State. Essentially
the right to bear arms is akin to the right to revolution
as set forth in the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>The person, his or her papers and dwelling are
exempt from unwarrantable searches, seizure, or
invasion. The exemption here goes to the fundamental
supremacy of the civil over the military
authority. A warrantable search is lawful because
the sovereign—the State or the United States—has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
the primary right of self-protection, safety,
peace, good order,—indeed, the right to realize the
essential purposes and ends of sovereignty. But the
boundary between private right and public necessity
(another expression for sovereignty) must be drawn
with precision. The language of the Fourth Amendment
is explicit.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a></p>

<p>154. The first ten amendments prohibit the
United States from violating the fundamental rights
of persons; they are a protection against federal
tyranny. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments
prohibit the States from violating certain
fundamental rights of persons. Any one comparing
the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments discovers
the same language as to “due process of law” and
“life, liberty, and property.” The State constitutions
protect persons in like manner. Thus the
fundamental right prevails in both jurisdictions,—that
of the State and that of the United States.</p>

<p>The Fifth Amendment does not exempt a person
from presentment or indictment, or trial, but recognizes
his fundamental right to protection by due
process of law.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
The protection of the person is of his life, liberty,
and property—his rights to either of which are
fundamental. Yet his life may be taken in defense
of the State, or of the United States; he may be
deprived of his liberty,—civil, political, or natural,—for
cause, and his property may be confiscated to the
State, or to the United States, for like reason. This
apparent conflict between theory and fact is in no
sense a violation of the fundamental right of the person
thus affected. He is entitled to his fundamental
rights; so are the several States and the United States
entitled to their respective fundamental rights: but
they are sovereignties; the person is not, and his
fundamental rights to life, liberty, and property give
place to the rights of the sovereign.</p>

<p>155. Neither the State government nor the federal
government is that sovereign, but each is an agent of
a sovereign. The sovereign can do no wrong. To
the extent that the individual person is identified with
sovereignty, he or she can do no wrong, and his or
her rights are primary as well as fundamental.
For this reason the first ten amendments specify
the protection and the guarantees which apply to
the person as against the powers of the Government
of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
The test whether or not there is invasion of the
fundamental rights which are excepted out of the
powers of government is the issue, “Is sovereignty
imperiled?” As against sovereignty, the person has
in the final test no rights whatever: that is no rights
that are recognized and protected by constitutional
law. The supreme test is, however, rarely made.</p>

<p>156. The fundamental rights outlined in the
first ten, and in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth
Amendments to the Constitution are essentially the
right of the person to the protection of sovereignty
against acts of the government. The nature of this
protection is expressed in the Ninth and Tenth
Amendments. Sovereignty does not define its
rights; it defines or enumerates powers which it
delegates to government. Were sovereignty to
define (if it were possible to define) its rights, it
would limit itself, and to that extent cease being
sovereign. The fundamental rights<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> thus reserved
(in addition to those already mentioned but not in
any sense exhaustive) are, the right of equality before
the law; of consequent equal protection of the laws;
of the exercise of the police power; of education; of
employment; of making contracts; of trial by jury; of
being a person (not a thing) and to realize and possess
the privileges and immunities thereunto pertaining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
157. Practically, these fundamental rights are
realized through the judiciary when the issue and test
of their existence arise. Thus we turn to judicial
decisions for the interpretation of these rights, or
for declaration, in official form, of their primary
rank as “reserved to the people or to the States.”
All legislation, State or federal, must conform to
them. Whether it actually does so conform is determinable
in and by courts of law, on the principle,
declared by Chief Justice Marshall, that “it is emphatically
the province and duty of the judicial
department to say what the law is.” Thus for the
protection of these fundamental rights the judiciary,
by every principle of American constitutional law,
is final, unless the sovereign arouses himself and
changes the function, or office of the judiciary
itself.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> The sovereign may thus act, as the people of
a State, or of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> The now familiar
decision of the Supreme Court as to the power of
Congress over American territory (as differing
from a State in the Union)<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> recognizes and declares
that there are certain principles of natural justice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
which secure dependencies against legislation manifestly
hostile to their real interests. These “principles
of natural justice” as applied to constitutional
government and law undoubtedly mean fundamental
rights which secure persons, anywhere under
American jurisdiction, “against legislation manifestly
hostile to their real interests”; for the essential
interest of the person,—that is, the “citizen” as
defined in the Constitution,—is the interest of the
sovereign,—the people of the United States, or of a
State.</p>

<p>158. It is evident that there is a close relation
between the law of constitutional limitations and the
law of fundamental rights in America. A limitation
is not always a right, in law; a right is not always a
limitation; but the law of constitutional government
in America—and this means the constitutional law
of America—is worked out by judicial interpretation
of these limitations and these rights.</p>

<p>The right of freedom of worship and of exemption
from compulsion to attend any place of worship is not
violated by reading from the Bible in the public
schools, or reading selections from the Bible. Such
a reading does not convert the public school into a
religious or theological seminary, nor is the reading
a conversion of the public money to the use of a religious
sect. “I am not able to see,” observed the
court, “why extracts from the Bible should be proscribed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
when the youth are taught no better authenticated
truths from profane history.”<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> If under the
influence of a religious belief (polygamy) that it was
right, a man deliberately married a second time
having a first wife living, the want of consciousness
of evil intent did not excuse him, but criminal intent
would be implied.<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p>The compulsory production of a man’s private
papers to establish a criminal charge against him is
within the scope of the Fourth Amendment to the
Constitution, in all cases in which a search or seizure
would be; because it is a material ingredient, and
effects the sole object of the search and seizure.
Compulsory production of papers is unwarrantable
search and seizure. Such unwarrantable seizure of
books and papers is compelling a person to be a
witness against himself. The offense consists in the
“invasion of the indefeasible right of personal
security.” The manner of the invasion whether by
force or by quiet entrance is not the violation; the
violation of the right is the invasion of it, in whatever
manner.<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The law is perfectly well settled that the first ten
amendments to the Constitution, commonly known as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
the Bill of Rights, were not intended to lay down any
novel principles of government, but simply to embody
certain guaranties and immunities which we had inherited
from our English ancestors, and which had, from
time immemorial, been subject to certain well-recognized
exceptions arising from the necessities of the case. In
incorporating these principles into the fundamental law
there was no intention of disregarding the exceptions,
which continued to be recognized as they had been
formally expressed. Thus the freedom of speech and
of the press (Art. i.) does not permit the publication
of libels, blasphemous, or indecent articles, or
other publications injurious to public morals or private
reputation; the right of the people to keep
and bear arms (Art. x., 11) is not infringed by laws
prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons; the
provision that no person shall be twice put in jeopardy,
(Art. v.) does not prevent a second trial, if upon the
first trial the jury failed to agree, or if the verdict was
set aside upon the defendant’s motion (United States <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr>
Ball, 163 U. S., 662, 672); nor does the provision of the
same article that no one shall be a witness against himself
impair his obligation to testify, if a prosecution against
him be barred by the lapse of time, or by statutory
enactment (Brown <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Walker, 161 U. S., 591 and cases
cited); nor does the provision that an accused person
shall be confronted with the witnesses against him
prevent the admission of dying declarations, or the depositions
of witnesses who have died since the former
trial.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p></blockquote>

<p>159. “The words ‘due process of law’ were
undoubtedly intended to convey the same meaning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
as the words, ‘by the law of the land’ in Magna
Charta.” This means, in American constitutional
law, to use Webster’s words in the Dartmouth
College case,—“the general law—a law which hears
before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry,
and renders judgment only after trial.” Cooley
states it as meaning “that every citizen shall hold
his life, liberty, property, and immunities, under the
protection of the general rules which govern society.”<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a></p>

<p>This means that whatever is the actual law of the
land, the regular and established practice of courts
and the legal landmarks of society defines the
meaning of the phrase “due process of law.” A
man who by the laws of his State has had a fair trial
in a court of justice, according to the modes of
proceeding applicable to such a case has been tried
by due process of law.<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a></p>

<p>It is within the police power of a State to regulate
the hours during which a business, say washing and
ironing, may be carried on, and the kind of building,
whether or not fireproof, which may be used for
such business, but discrimination against citizens or
aliens effecting the elimination of certain citizens or
aliens from carrying on the business, while others are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
permitted to carry it on under similar conditions is
a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment which
secures to every person the equal protection of the
laws. The discrimination is none the less unconstitutional
because the person discriminated against
is an alien, when the treaty between the United
States and the sovereignty to which the alien owes
allegiance secures to the alien in the United States
“the same rights, privileges, immunities, and exemptions
as may be enjoyed by the citizens or subjects
of the most favored nation.” For a treaty is part of
the supreme law of the land.<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a></p>

<p>The principle here also includes another well-settled
rule of American constitutional law, that
while a State may exercise its police power within
its own jurisdiction, imposing restrictions on foreign
corporations doing business within its territory, it
cannot so exercise its police power as to infringe upon
interstate or foreign commerce. Thus a police regulation
of a State which prevents or obstructs, directly
or indirectly, a corporation within its territory, as a
party that is engaged or would be engaged in commerce,
conflicts with the power of Congress to
regulate commerce and therefore is unconstitutional.
But police regulation of the corporation as to other
matters is not a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
The principle here is “to exclude everything
that is arbitrary and capricious in legislation affecting
the rights of the citizen.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>

<p>160. The Fourteenth Amendment takes no police
powers from the States that were reserved to them
when the Constitution was adopted. The States
may still do lawfully as they will with their own, and
this means that they will exercise authority over their
own jurisdiction. That Amendment “in declaring
that no State” shall deprive any person of life,
liberty, or property without due process of law, nor
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal
protection of the laws, undoubtedly intended not
only that there should be no arbitrary deprivation of
life or liberty, or arbitrary spoliation of property,
but that equal protection and security should be
given to all under like circumstances in the enjoyment
of their personal and civil rights; that all
persons should be equally entitled to pursue their
happiness and acquire and enjoy property; that
they should have like access to the courts of the
country for the protection of their persons and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
property, the prevention and redress of wrongs, and
the enforcement of contracts; that no impediment
should be interposed to the pursuits of any one
except as applied to the same pursuits by others
under like circumstances; that no greater burdens
should be laid upon one than are laid upon others
in the same calling and condition, and that in the
administration of criminal justice no different or
higher punishment should be imposed upon one than
such as is prescribed to all for like offenses. But
neither the Amendment, broad and comprehensive
as it is, nor any other Amendment was designed to
interfere with the power of the State, sometimes
termed its police power, to prescribe regulations to
promote the health, peace, morals, education, and
good order of the people, and to legislate so as to
increase the industries of the State, develop its
resources, and add to its wealth and prosperity.
From the very necessities of society, legislation of a
special character, having these objects in view, must
often be had in certain districts, such as for draining
marshes and irrigating arid plains. Special burdens
are often necessary for general benefits,—for supplying
water, preventing fires, lighting districts, cleaning
streets, opening parks, and many other objects.
Regulations for these purposes may press with more
or less weight upon one than upon another, but they
are designed, not to impose unequal or unnecessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
restrictions upon any one, but to promote, with as
little individual inconvenience as possible, the
general good. Though, in many respects, necessarily
special in their character, they do not furnish just
ground of complaint if they operate alike upon all
persons and property under the same circumstances
and conditions. Class legislation, discriminating
against some and favoring others, is prohibited; but
legislation which, in carrying out a public purpose, is
limited in its application, if within the sphere of its
operation it affects alike all persons similarly situated
is not within the Amendment.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a></p>

<p>161. The right of trial by jury, reserved as a
fundamental right, is a common law right of great
antiquity. As the word “jury” is used in the Constitution,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
and as jury trial is secured by the Seventh
Amendment, its meaning must be discovered from
English history and common-law practice. That
history and that practice alike prove that only a
court of law can have a jury, and that a body of men
free from judicial control is not and never was a
common-law jury; that is, according to the Seventh
Amendment, a constitutional jury is a jury in a
court of record, and a number of men, a so-called
jury in a court of a justice of the peace, is not a jury
in the sense in which that word is used in the Constitution.
A court, when we consider its derivation
and history, comprises the judge assisting the jury
and the jury assisting the judge. The right of trial
by jury means for many purposes the same as the
right to due process of law.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p>162. The fundamentals of government are a
unit, like government itself, and he who rests his
case on one fundamental right really rests his case
on all. The principle which permeates and includes
all these fundamentals—usually set forth in Bills of
Rights—is thus expressed by the Supreme Court:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When we consider the nature and the theory of our
institutions of government, the principles upon which
they are supposed to rest, and review the history of their
development, we are constrained to conclude that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
do not mean to leave room for the play and action of
purely personal and arbitrary power. Sovereignty itself
is, of course, not subject to law, for it is the author and
source of law; but in our system, while sovereign powers
are delegated to the agencies of government, sovereignty
itself remains with the people, by whom and for whom all
government exists and acts. And the law is the definition
and limitation of power. It is, indeed, quite true,
that there must always be lodged somewhere, and in
some person or body, the authority of final decision;
and in many cases of mere administration the responsibility
is purely political, no appeal lying except to the
ultimate tribunal of the public judgment, exercised
either in the pressure of opinion or by means of the
suffrage. But the fundamental rights to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, considered as individual
possessions, are secured by those maxims of constitutional
law which are the monuments showing the victorious
progress of the race in securing to men the
blessings of civilization under the reign of just and equal
laws, so that, in the famous language of the Massachusetts
Bill of Rights, the government of the Commonwealth
“may be a government of laws and not of men.”
For the very idea that one man may be compelled to hold
his life, or the means of living, or any material right
essential to the enjoyment of life, at the mere will of
another, seems to be intolerable in any country where
freedom prevails, as being the essence of slavery itself.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p></blockquote>

<span class="subhead">THE LAW OF CITIZENSHIP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>163. “All persons born or naturalized in the
United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof,
are citizens of the United States, and of the State
wherein they reside.”<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> The phrase “subject to the
jurisdiction thereof” excludes “children of ministers,
consuls, and citizens or subjects of foreign states
born within the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> The supreme law
clearly recognizes and establishes a distinction between
United States citizenship and State citizenship.
To be a citizen of a State, a person must reside
within that State, but to be a citizen of the United
States, it is necessary only that he or she be born or
naturalized within the jurisdiction of the United
States. Thus American citizenship, like the operation
of American constitutional law in all its aspects,
is a matter of jurisdiction, or sovereignty.</p>

<p>In America there are two citizenships, distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
from each other, and depending upon different
characteristics and circumstances, and the essential
difference is caused by a difference of jurisdiction.
In strict conformity to this distinction, the Constitution
prohibits a State from making or enforcing “any
law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States.”<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> The limitation
is not as to laws affecting the privileges and immunities
of citizens of the several States; equality of
citizens of States is secured by another provision.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>The privileges and immunities of the citizen of one
State removing to another State are the same, no
more, no less, than the privileges and immunities of
the citizens of the State into which he or she removed.<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>
The privileges and immunities of citizens
of the several States rest for security and protection
with the States themselves,—where they rested
before the Constitution was made. These privileges
and immunities are not placed under the care of the
United States except so far as the Constitution
declares that, “The citizens of each State shall be
entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens
in the several States.” These privileges and immunities
of citizens of the several States are <em>fundamental</em>,<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a>
and are commonly set forth in Bills of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Rights found in the State constitutions. The sole
purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to declare
to the several States that</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">whatever those rights,—as you grant or establish them
to your own citizens, or as you limit, or qualify, or
impose restrictions on their exercise, the same, neither
more nor less, shall be the measure of the rights of citizens
of other States within your jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p></blockquote>

<p>164. What then are the privileges and immunities
of citizens of the United States? They are the
privileges and immunities secured to them by the
Constitution. Among them are</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">to come to the seat of government to assert any claim he
may have upon that government; to transact any business
he may have with it; to share its offices; to engage in
administering its functions; the right of free access to its
seaports, through which all operations of foreign commerce
are conducted; to the subtreasuries, land offices,
and courts of justice in the several States<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>; “to demand
the care and protection of the federal government over
his life, liberty, and property when on the high seas, or
within the jurisdiction of a foreign government; to
peaceably assemble and petition for redress of grievances;
the privilege of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">habeas corpus</i>; to use the navigable waters
of the United States however they may penetrate the
territory of the several States; all rights secured to
(American) citizens by treaties with foreign nations”;
the right, on his own volition to become a citizen of any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
State of the United States by a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">bona fide</i> residence therein,
with the same rights as other citizens of that State.<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus it appears that the rights of a citizen—his
“privileges and immunities”—are measurable by the
jurisdiction of the sovereignty to which he owes
allegiance. Between allegiance and protection as
between citizenship and sovereignty there is a
reciprocal relation.</p>

<p>165. The Fourteenth Amendment did not add
to the privileges and immunities of a citizen.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> It
simply furnished an additional guaranty to the protection
of such as he already had. It did not add
the right of suffrage to these privileges and immunities
as they existed at the time of the adoption of
the Constitution. The United States guarantees to
every State in the Union a republican form of
government,<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> but this is not a guarantee to any
citizen of the right to vote, nor does the Constitution
confer that right on any person.<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> That right (or
privilege, as it is in strict contemplation of law) was
not the same among the original States, the qualifications
for voting differing widely among them, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
also in the same State at different times.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> When the
Constitution confers citizenship it does not confer
the right to vote.</p>

<p>There is, however, a right to vote possessed by certain
citizens of the United States, namely they
who vote for members of Congress and Senators of
the United States, and (by implication) electors of
President and Vice-President. The Constitution
defines electors of Congressmen and Senators as the
same persons who are entitled in the several States
to vote for the most numerous branch of the State
Legislature.<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> The United States thus</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">adopts the qualification thus furnished as the qualification
of its own electors of Congress. It is not true, therefore,
that electors for members of Congress owe their
right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes
the exercise of the right depend exclusively on the law
of the State.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The United States has sovereign power to prescribe
electoral qualifications for its own citizens; it
has chosen to adopt State qualifications. The non-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>exercise
of the power does not work denial of its
existence. The principle involved is one of sovereignty,
that non-user of a sovereign right cannot
invalidate the right.</p>

<p>166. While the Fourteenth Amendment added
nothing to the rights and privileges of citizens, for
“the equality of the rights of citizens is a principle
of republicanism,”<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> it guaranteed those rights; but
“the power of the national government is limited
to the enforcement of the guaranty.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> The Amendment
does not invest Congress with power to legislate
upon subjects which are within the domain of State
legislation; but to provide modes of relief against
State legislation, or State action “which impairs the
privileges and immunities of citizens of the United
States, or which injures them in life, liberty, or
property without due process of law, or which denies
to them the equal protection of the laws.”<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> Congress
is empowered by the Amendment “to adopt appropriate
legislation for correcting the effects of such
prohibited State laws and State acts, and thus to
render them effectually null, void, and innocuous.”<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>The essential matter here involved is sovereignty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The true doctrine is, that whilst the States are really
sovereign as to all matters which have not been granted to
the jurisdiction and control of the United States, the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
and constitutional laws of the latter are the
supreme law of the land; and when they conflict with the
laws of the States, they are of paramount authority and
obligation. This is the fundamental principle on which
the authority of the Constitution is based; and unless it
be conceded in practice, as well as theory, the fabric of
our institutions, as it was contemplated by its founders,
cannot stand. The questions involved have respect not
more to the autonomy and existence of the States, than
to the continued existence of the United States as a
government to which every American citizen may look
for security and protection in every part of the land.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thus, in application of this principle, the law of a
State discriminating against persons of color by
eliminating them to serve as jurors is unconstitutional.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
So too is an act of Congress unconstitutional,
that operates as, or creates, a municipal law
for the regulation of private rights, and that places
Congress in the stead, or office of the State legislatures,
so that the federal Legislature, instead of
enacting laws corrective of prohibited State laws, or
counteracting such laws, assumes the office of the
State legislatures in their general legislation. Such
Congressional legislation “steps into the domain of
local jurisprudence.”<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a></p>

<p>167. Such unconstitutional legislation by Congress
was the Civil Rights Bill of 1866, which declared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
that all persons within the jurisdiction of the United
States should be entitled</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,
advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public
conveyances on land or water, theaters, and other places
of public amusement; subject only to the conditions and
limitations established by law, and applicable to citizens
of every race and color, regardless of any previous condition
of servitude.<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Here again the essential matter is one of jurisdiction,
or sovereignty. The several States have
jurisdiction over the matters comprised within the
so-called Civil Rights Bill. Inn-keepers, public
carriers, owners or managers of theaters and public
halls are bound, to the extent of their facilities, to
furnish proper accommodations to all unobjectionable
persons who in good faith apply for them. No race
or class is a special favorite of the laws, and the
enjoyment of accommodations in inns, public conveyances,
and places of amusement, is not a “privilege
or immunity” of a citizen, in the sense that he
or she possesses a civil or legal right to such enjoyment.
The act, or decision, of a mere individual,—the
owner of an inn, or of a public conveyance, or
place of amusement, refusing such accommodation,
is not the imposition of a badge of slavery or involuntary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
servitude upon the applicant; neither does such
act or decision inflict a civil injury, unless the law
of the State makes such act or decision an injury.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a></p>

<p>The principle here involved is illustrated by a law
of California, held to be constitutional by the
Supreme Court of the United States, that “due
process of law” is not denied to a person who, in that
State, by its law, was “prosecuted by information,”
and (as was claimed) was “tried and illegally found
guilty of (murder) without any presentment or
indictment of any grand or other jury.”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>The Court sustained the State law as securing due
process of law in principle,—that “prosecution by
information” instead of “indictment of a jury” is
not a violation of the principle but merely a variation
of the form of due process of law.<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> In other words,
the California law in no way disparaged or abridged
the privileges or immunities of the citizen.<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
168. The principle regulating the definition of
United States citizenship is that principle of the
common law which recognizes “the ancient rule of
citizenship by birth within the dominion.”<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></p>

<p>Naturalization is an artificial birth made possible
by the will of sovereignty. It is effected by the
operation of law,—and in America, by operation of
statutory law only. Congress has not the exclusive
power to pass naturalization laws, but it has the
exclusive power “to establish a <em>uniform</em> rule of
naturalization.”<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> The power exercised here is suggested
in the word “uniform.”<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> Congress has seen
fit to vest the exercise of this power in certain courts
of law. Strictly speaking, the exercise of the function,
in any of its aspects, is not essentially judicial.
Courts of law have no functions, can exercise no
functions, and no functions can be imposed upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
them except those of a judicial nature.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> If the
courts are willing to exercise a ministerial function
and are empowered to exercise it by Congress, as in
the naturalization of aliens, that exercise cannot be
questioned as being unconstitutional.</p>

<p>169. The test here is jurisdiction. A person may
by voluntary expatriation become allegiant to another
jurisdiction or sovereignty, but he cannot escape
allegiance to some one jurisdiction. He must be
citizen or subject of a sovereignty. As all property
capable of ownership must have an owner, so must
every person be citizen or subject of some sovereignty.
A vessel, wherever it may be, is part of the
territory of the country to which it belongs.<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> By
parity of reasoning a person is deemed allegiant to
some jurisdiction or sovereignty. A vessel owning
no jurisdiction is a pirate.</p>

<p>170. The Fifteenth Amendment declares that the
right of citizens of the United States to vote shall
not be denied or abridged by the United States or
by any State on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude. This Amendment</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">does not take away from the State governments in a
general sense the power over suffrage which has belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
to those governments from the beginning, and without
the provision of which power the whole fabric upon
which the division of State and national authority under
the Constitution and the organization of both governments
rest would be without support and both the
authority of the nation and of the State would fall to the
ground. In fact, the very command of the Amendment
recognizes the possession of the general power by the
States since the Amendment seeks to regulate its exercise
as to the particular subject with which it deals.<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> The
Amendment does not change, modify, or deprive the
States of their full power as to suffrage, except of course
as to the subject with which the Amendment deals, and
to the extent that obedience to its command is necessary.
Thus the authority over the suffrage which the States
possess, and the limitations which the Amendment
imposes, are co-ordinate, and one may not destroy the
other without bringing about the destruction of both.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p></blockquote>

<p>But while the Amendment “gives no right of
suffrage”</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... the result might arise that as a consequence of the
striking down of a discriminating clause, a right of
suffrage would be enjoyed by reason of the generic
character of the provision which would remain after
the discrimination was stricken out.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
171. Both the States and the United States are
forbidden by the Constitution to enact <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i>
laws. The prohibition affects every citizen as securing
him from the peril of legislation of the kind
forbidden. It is a sweeping limitation of power for
his or her benefit, and operates for all citizens of
whatever age, condition, or circumstance. An <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex
post facto</i> law is one that makes an action done before
the passing of the law, and which was innocent
when done, criminal, and punishes that action; that
aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than it was
when committed; that changes the punishment and
inflicts a greater punishment than the law annexed
to the crime when committed; that alters the legal
rules of evidence, and receives less or different
testimony than the law required, at the time of
the commission of the offense, in order to convict the
offender. But no law is <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post facto</i> within the
constitutional prohibition that “mollifies the rigor
of the criminal law.” Only those laws are <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ex post
facto</i> which “create, or aggravate the crime, or
increase the punishment, or change the rules of
evidence, for the purpose of conviction.”<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
172. But he who, under State law, voluntarily
waived his right of trial by jury and elected to be
tried by the court and by it was adjudged guilty and
was condemned to be hanged, was not deprived of
any right, privilege, or immunity for his protection
by the Fourteenth Amendment, but was tried and
condemned in strict accordance with the forms prescribed
by the constitution and laws of the State,
and with special regard to the rights of accused
persons under its jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> A person may waive
a fundamental right<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> but neither the State nor the
United States can lawfully invade the indefeasible
right of a person to personal security<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a>; such invasion
constitutes an “unwarrantable search and seizure.”
The service of a lawful warrant operates practically
as a waiver of right by the person searched or seized;
but were a person to waive his right, say of trial by
jury, such waiver would not confer power on any
court or jury to try him. “Consent can never
confer jurisdiction.”<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></p>

<p>173. Am act of Congress that no person shall be
excused from attending and testifying, or from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
producing books, papers, tariffs, contracts, agreements,
and documents before the Interstate Commerce
Commission, or in obedience to its subpœna,
on the ground that he might thus be compelled to be
a witness against himself and so become subject to
penalty is constitutional because its additional
provision immuning him from future prosecution by
reason of his evidence thus given sufficiently satisfies
the constitutional guarantee of protection.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a></p>

<p>So too the stenographic report of testimony given
in court, supported by the oath of the stenographer
that it is a correct transcript of his notes and of
the testimony of a deceased witness is competent
evidence, is admissible, and does not conflict with the
provision of the Constitution that an accused person
shall have the right “to be confronted with the
witnesses against him.”<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> The principle here is
essentially one of sovereignty,—the court declaring:
“the rights of the public shall not be wholly sacrificed
in order that an incidental benefit may be preserved
to the accused.”<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> The sovereign right of a State, or
of the United States with respect to citizenship, is
sufficient, in either, to effect the purposes for which
either exists; but in the American dual system of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
government, citizenship has fundamental rights,
which are guaranteed, and political privileges, which
are conferred and protected.</p>

<p>174. Civil rights and their guarantees, both in
the States and in the United States, are formulated
as limitations on government,—as fundamentals
reserved “and above any constitutional sanction.”
These rights include those of religious liberty, personal
security, security of dwellings, papers, and
property, personal freedom, due process of law, jury
trial, and equal protection of the laws. The line of
demarcation between these fundamental rights is
not easily drawn, nor even drawn with precision.
These rights, being fundamental rights, exist independent
of the government which the people of a
State, or the people of the United States ordain and
establish. That sovereignty—the people themselves—has
power to alter, to modify, or even to
destroy these rights, or any of them, must be admitted,
but that sovereignty ever, under a republican
form of government, will alter, modify, or destroy
these rights, may with equal assurance be denied.</p>

<p>175. The political privileges of citizenship rest on
a different conception of government. Political
privileges—of which the most important are the
right to vote and the right to be voted for, and to
execute an office because of election to office—are
not fundamental, that is, they are not civil rights.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
The State, or the United States, has the right to
prescribe qualifications for an elector, or for candidacy
for any office. Usually these qualifications are
of age, residence, sex, and tax-paying,—the people of
the United States having also declared that the right
of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be
denied or abridged by the United States, or by any
State, on account of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude. This inhibition does not make the fact
of race, or color, or previous condition of servitude
a fundamental civil right guaranteed by the United
States under the Constitution. In no sense does the
Fourteenth Amendment confuse civil and political
rights. No person can vote unless he or she has
complied with the requirements (qualifications) for
voting, prescribed by the State in which he or she
resides. No person acquires civil rights by a similar
compliance. By birth or naturalization (and naturalization
is a sort of legal birth by the will of the
sovereign), a person possesses civil rights, but no
person possesses the privilege of voting either by
birth or by naturalization. The privilege of voting
may be lost by removing from a polling district; by
neglect to register; by neglect to pay a tax,—in brief,
by failure to comply with any electoral law of the
State; but no person forfeits his or her civil rights by
mere neglect. Infants, minors, adults, men, women,
and children possess equal civil rights. Impairment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
suspension, forfeiture of civil rights is effected only
by commission of crime, that is, by a voluntary act,
inimical to sovereignty itself. Such an act also cuts
off the privilege of voting, or of being voted for with
effect of induction into office, because the person who
imperils sovereignty by commission of a crime would,
in all probability, imperil sovereignty by voting.
The exercise of the suffrage has long continued in
America, and, both in laws and in constitutions, is
commonly referred to as a “right.” The tendency
of privileges is to become rights. In America, however,
the republican form of government exists both
in the States and in the United States. Practically,
civil rights and political privileges are determined by
the will of the people.</p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> The Supreme Court of Mississippi in Sproule <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Fredericks, 69
Miss. 898 (1892), decided that the Constitutional Convention of that
State (1890) “wielded the powers of sovereignty specially delegated
to it, for the purpose and the occasion, by the whole electoral body,
for the good of the whole Commonwealth.” The Supreme Court of
Pennsylvania in Wells <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Bain, 75 Pa. St. 39 (1874), decided that the
Convention of 1872 was “not a co-ordinate branch of the government,”
and possessed only “delegated powers.” The Supreme
Court of the United States, through Marshall, C. J., decided in McCulloch
<abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Maryland, 4 Wheaton, 316 (1819), that the Constitution
which came from the hands of the Federal Convention of 1787 “was
a mere proposal, without obligation, or pretensions to it. By the
Convention, by Congress, and by the State Legislatures, the instrument
was submitted to the people. They acted upon it, in the only
manner in which they can act safely, effectively, and wisely, on such
a subject, by assembling in convention. It is true they assembled
in their several States; and where else should they have assembled?
No political dreamer was ever wild enough to think of breaking down
the lines which separate the States, and of compounding the American
people into one common mass. Of consequence when they act, they
act in their States. But the measures they adopt do not, on that
account, cease to be the measures of the people themselves, or become
the measures of the State governments. From these conventions
the Constitution derives its whole authority. The government
proceeds directly from the people; is “ordained and established” in
the name of the people; and is declared to be ordained, “in order to@
form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and to
their posterity.” The assent of the States in their sovereign capacity
is implied in calling a convention, and thus submitting that instrument
to the people. But the people were at perfect liberty to accept
or reject it; and their act was final. It required not the affirmance,
and could not be negatived by the State governments. The Constitution
when thus adopted was of complete obligation, and bound
the State sovereignties.” The character of the Constitution, its
purport and principles, is examined in Martin <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Hunter’s Lessee, 1
Wheaton, 304 (1816). Decision by Story, J.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Every question in constitutional law, in the United States, sooner
or later leads back to a question of sovereignty. What that sovereignty
is can be known only by its operation,—that is, by political
experience. What powers are delegated by the Constitution is the
question answered (at least in part) by courts of law and legislatures,
by publicists and by the actual administration of government.
Widely divergent interpretations of that sovereignty and that law
have been held throughout our history as a nation. These divergent
opinions are recorded in the Debates during the formation and ratification
of the Constitution; in the discussions incident to the Kentucky
and Virginia Resolutions of 1798; in the discussions relating to Nullification,
in 1833; again in 1860 and immediately prior; and in various
decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States. Chief Justice
Marshall’s decisions (some thirty-six in number), the opinion of that
Court in his time, remain the classic interpretation of national sovereignty.
<cite>The Federalist</cite> remains the classic contemporaneous interpretation
of the Constitution.
</p>
<p>
The issue involved is, fundamentally, one of <em>functions</em>, and is
viewed at different times with different understandings. As a practical
question, it is one of <em>jurisdiction</em> as legally understood, but as a
question of <em>service</em> as politically understood. Here enter many and
diverse factors as morals, industry, communal interest, public safety,
social needs, and the like. Questions growing out of these are not
and cannot be decided finally by any generation. Each generation
interprets these factors. Thus constitutional interpretation becomes,
not a fixed quantity, but an adjustment to reason and necessity.
Prudence dictates that interpretation be conservative. The
constitutional and political history of America must be read along
with its constitutional law. In addition to cases already cited in this
chapter, the following may advantageously be read, though each
contains matter of special application to other aspects of the subject:

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_73" href="#FNanchor_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> An account of the struggles of political parties, and of the successive
decisions of the Supreme Court as to Legal Tender Acts belongs
to the history of the law rather than to a statement of the
essentials of present constitutional law. Accounts of this struggle,
available in histories of the United States, may be compared with
Justice Stephen J. Field’s account in J. Norton Pomeroy’s <cite>Some
Account of the Work of Stephen J. Field as a Legislator, State Judge,
and Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States</cite> (1881), (Edition
by George C. Gorham, 1895) pp. 65–86. Mr. Justice Field’s dissenting
opinions from the decisions of the Supreme Court which sustain
the constitutionality of the Acts are based largely on his conception
of the principle of the obligation of a contract as contained in the
Constitution respecting “gold and silver coin.” For the history of
the Acts, the decision of the Court invalidating them (1869); the
increase of the membership of the Court (1870); the reversal of the
earlier decisions (1871), and the final decision in Juilliard <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> Greenman

of his salary as income taxable under the Sixteenth Amendment
is as yet not determined by judicial decision. “The corporate
franchises, the property, the business, the income of corporations
created by a State may undoubtedly be taxed by the State; but in
imposing such taxes care should be taken not to interfere with or
hamper, directly or by indirection, interstate or foreign commerce, or
any other matter exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Federal
government. This is a principle so often announced by the courts,
and especially by this court (the Supreme Court of the United

There is widespread belief in America now that the President

United States Senators. At present the “electoral vote” is 531; the
person receiving the majority of these 531 votes is President of the

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_421" href="#FNanchor_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> As sovereignty is a unit, any examination of particular aspects
of it must be but a partial examination of its operations. The
Constitution of the United States is a unit, in so far as the sovereignty,—the
people of the United States,—have made it the expression
of their plan of government. It follows that close examination of
any department or feature of the Constitution as a plan of government
discloses that feature in relation with other features; the Constitution
is an expression of a mass of relations. Thus it is that a
decision of the Supreme Court may relate to several matters, seemingly
without relation, but necessarily co-related. The present
chapter on <i><a href="#CHAPTER_X">The Law of Limitations</a></i> discusses executive, legislative,
and judiciary and the principles of government by which it acts. <em>The
entire subject of American constitutional law must be viewed as a whole.</em>

of citizens of the United States against abridgment by the States,
and in effect the same decision was made in respect of the guarantee
against prosecution, except by indictment of a grand jury in the
Fifth Amendment (Hurtado <abbr xml:lang="la" lang="la">v.</abbr> California, 110 U. S., 516) and with

the Fifth Amendment, and the trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth
Amendment, were not privileges and immunities of citizens of the
United States, as those words were used in the Fourteenth Amendment....
We conclude, therefore, that the exemption from
compulsory self-incrimination (‘see <a href="#ARTICLE_V">Amendment V</a>.’) is not a

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
